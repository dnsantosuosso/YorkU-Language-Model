However, the statements are based on management's financial reporting objectives (e.g. profit maximization; income smoothing; tax minimization), as well as on many management estimates and disclosure decisions. Statements based on GAAP do not usually reflect the needs of the individual user. In this course, students will learn to apply diagnostic, analytical and judgmental skills to understanding financial statements from the point of view of external users who need to make various types of decisions such as performance evaluation, loan decisions, and stock valuation.</p>

This course therefore offers a direct link between accounting policy choices, abnormal earnings (based on adjusted reported earnings) and stock price valuation.</p>

Classical finance incorporates fully rational, unemotional agents; financial decisions are made without the influence of emotions or personal characteristics. Much recent study contradicts this view. By examining psychological factors known to influence individual choice and financial decision-making we can identify behavioural biases that are both reliable and exploitable. With care, many of these biasis can be avoided.

It provides insights into the sustainability challenges and how finance can address these challenges with sustainable investing. Sustainable finance integrates ESG criteria into financial decisions to allocate funding to its most productive use, whereas traditional finance focuses solely on financial return and risk. Students will gain a foundation in understanding the principles underlying sustainable and responsible decision-making in finance, the guidelines on how to apply them in business and investment practice, and how regulations and market forces provide incentives that encourage desired corporate and investor behaviors.</p>

This seminar examines these novel approaches to responsible<br />
business at depth. Students will examine key legacy works that are the foundation of these novel approaches as well as more recent scholarly advances. During the seminar, students will develop a deep appreciation for these works as well a critical basis for making their own contributions to these deepening conversations.</p>
<p>Specifically, by the end of this course you should be able to:<br />
• Understand, recall, and explain core texts in the field of responsible business;<br />
• Evaluate and critique research in the field;<br />
• Recognize and contribute to leading edge theory and research in the field.</p>

By the conclusion of the course, students: (a) are familiar with important sources and references on prevailing issues in organization theory; (b) have a solid grasp of advanced theory and research on a breadth of topics in macro organizational behaviour; (c) have a better understanding of the process of writing theoretical articles; and (d) possess the ability to evaluate critically the contributions of various research streams to the field of organization theory.</p>
