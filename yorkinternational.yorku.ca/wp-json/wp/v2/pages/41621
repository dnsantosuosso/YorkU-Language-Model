It is required that you submit a completed course assessment form prior to your exchange program.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 1<\/strong>: visit your partner institution website and review the courses that are available to exchange students. Note that students must maintain a full-time student status at their host institution, which could range from 3-6 courses in total.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 2<\/strong>: collect any information available from the host institution about the courses you wish to take overseas. Find the syllabus, course outlines, and course descriptions that can help your academic department review the course content.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 3<\/strong>: complete your course assessment form and submit it to your academic department. Be sure to include as much supporting information as possible (see step 2). To find the undergraduate program director (UPD) or Department Chair, you may use <a href=\"https:\/\/atlas.cafe.uit.yorku.ca\/atlas\/servlet\/atlas\/template\/Index.vm\">York Atlas<\/a> and search by Department.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 4<\/strong>: Wait to hear from your academic department. Assessing course credit equivalency can take some time. The earlier you submit the form to your academic department, the better. Please allow for a minimum 4-6 weeks processing period.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>When are signatures required? Great question! We included some guiding principles below:\n<ul>\n<li>If a student wants to fulfill a lower-level elective (1000\/2000) outside of their major, no academic signature is required. Students must sign to confirm that they acknowledge credit transfer at this level.\n<ul>\n<li><sup>For example: If a student is a Science major and takes a Science course on an exchange through INEX without academic sign-off, they will only receive lower-level non-major (elective) credits toward their degree.<\/sup><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>If a student wants to fulfill an upper-level elective (3000\/4000) outside of their major, signature is required by the department (UPD, UPA, Chair, or faculty member) in the subject area<\/li>\n<li>If a student wants to fulfill a course to count toward their major, sign off is required at all levels (1000\/2000\/3000\/4000) \u2013 by the department (UPD, UPA, Chair, or faculty member) in the subject area<\/li>\n<li>All other courses (major\/minor) need sign off at all levels (1000\/2000\/3000\/4000) \u2013 by department (UPD, UPA, Chair, or faculty member) in the subject area.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Step 5<\/strong>: Submit your completed <a href=\"https:\/\/yorkinternational.apps01.yorku.ca\/machform\/view.php?id=547837\">form online<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Note<\/strong>: that credit systems differ around the world and sometimes it can be difficult to find all of the supporting information needed to submit to your academic department.&nbsp; The global learning team regularly offers credit transfer bootcamp sessions to help walk you through the process.
