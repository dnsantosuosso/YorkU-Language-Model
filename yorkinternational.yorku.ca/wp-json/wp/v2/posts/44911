Vorstermans is exploring L\u2019Arche, the international federation of non-profit organizations that supports communities where people with and without intellectual disabilities live and work together; how the organization coped with the unsavoury revelations about its founder; and how it is finding its way forward in the aftermath.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe research project is at the very early stages,\u201d said McDonnell, who has acquired new skills by doing a literature review and creating an annotated bibliography and is enjoying the entire experience.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI get to explore the city and contribute to research,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the highlights is meeting all the Mitacs interns from different places and hearing about their projects. There are so many options I never knew existed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Mitacs is a not-for-profit national research organization that, in partnership with Canadian academia, private industry and government, operates research and training programs in fields related to industrial and social innovation.<\/p>\n<p>Each summer, Mitacs\u2019 competitive Globalink Research Internship brings international undergraduates to Canada to do 12-week research internships under the supervision of academics in various fields; York has been participating since 2011. York\u2019s program has seen the numbers of both participating faculty and students grow over the past five years.<\/p>\n<p>These students \u2013 world-class undergraduate research talent -- apply for specific research projects and are chosen by faculty members at York eager to work with promising young researchers; they receive a stipend to support them during the internship. The GRI students work under the <a href=\"https:\/\/yorkinternational.yorku.ca\/global-learning\/incoming-global-learning\/ivrt\/\">International Visiting Research Trainee (IVRT)<\/a>&nbsp;Program, overseen by York International and available to any York faculty member wishing to host a student researcher from abroad<\/p>\n<p>This year, York University is hosting one of its largest cohort of more than 50 GRI students who are working with 25 York professors from six faculties and two schools. The students hail from 11 different countries: Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, France, Hong Kong, India, Mexico, Tunisia, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. Their projects include writing software to enable a robot to conduct long-duration autonomous tasks on the water; exploring the application of artificial intelligence, machine learning and GIS to climate change research, extreme weather analysis and data visualization; and creating a digital database and research website of biographical accounts of individuals born in Africa from the 16th to the 19th centuries.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThrough Mitacs, students gain excellent research experience and receive a stipend to support themselves while in Canada and the faculty obtain talented, eager research assistance at no cost to them,\u201d said <strong>Rachel Sung<\/strong>, Mitacs senior advisor, business development. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win opportunity.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Christo El Morr<\/strong>, an associate professor of health informatics, agrees.
