                "description": "                Since the death of George Floyd in May 2020, there have been several calls for research and grant proposals explicitly addressing the causes and effects of racialization and anti-Black racism. Meanwhile, the scholarly literature pertaining specifically to research involving Black Canadians is burgeoning but limited. The overall goal of this interdisciplinary symposium is to consolidate and expand the state of knowledge regarding how social science and health scholars conduct research in ways that can help Black Canadian communities flourish.            The symposium will consist of two panels, followed by learning circles between the panelists and graduate students.  The panelists include Dr. Anthony Kwame Harrison, Dr. Alicia Boatswain-Kyte, Dr. Bukola Salami, Dr. Giselle Thompson, Dr. Tanya Matthews, Dr. Tya Collins, and others.  Lunch and snacks will be served.  RSVP at forms.gle/YzNkfgpZ8MGaFoDV7.  This event is funded by a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Connection Grant and LA&amp;PS Research Events Fund.          ",

                "description": "(Un)comfortably Numb is a solo gallery exhibition by Colin Arthurs.    Location: Gales Gallery  Hours: 9 am to 5pm  Dates: October 30 to November 5  Reception: November 1 (6 pm to 9 pm)    Through artworks created across the mediums of painting, photography, and print, artist Colin Arthurs engages with contemporary constructions of disability, isolation, and masculinity to challenge and subvert modern conceptions of time, space, and identity. Having developed a nerve condition in his early teens that has left him without feeling in his arms and legs, Arthurs’ artworks explore the ways in which this diagnosis has altered aspects of his lifestyle and identity.    As a result of this condition, Arthurs has been deemed ineligible to follow in a long familial tradition of military service. In (Un)comfortably Numb, the artist confronts these unspoken expectations and lays bare the overwhelming struggle to assert one’s individuality and define an identity bereft of historical reciprocity. Works like Never Coming Home play with the uncomfortable complexity of expectation. While the portrait itself, a painted representation of a military headshot, is meant to immortalize the image of courage, pride, and tradition, the cool palette and title of the work situate the young subject in a numbing reality. Arthurs’ poignant portrait communicates a concept that too often becomes a truth; the overreliance on and dedication to preserving history often leads to the loss of a future. While Never Coming Home conveys this idea literally through the subject on the canvas, it also situates the artist and viewer in the conceptual realm of lost identity. Through an adept interaction between past and future, the works on display in (Un)comfortably Numb transcend traditional western boundaries of time and space.    The exhibit’s critical struggle with a traditional masculine identity is overtly explored through the artist’s stone lithograph series Peace was Never an Option and The Distinguished Gentleman. In yet another clever contradiction between subject and title, Arthurs offers an engaging analysis of “manliness” in Peace was Never an Option, a work depicting a male chicken sitting on the handle of an axe. Combining the historical symbolism of the chicken (cowardice and fear), the rooster (phallus and false bravado), and the axe (violence and sustenance), the artist deconstructs the false narrative of the man as a brave warrior and provider and questions this story’s role in contemporary society. The artwork asks the viewer what is more courageous, to blindly follow preconceived constructions of masculinity, or to refuse its enticing aura of acceptance and assurance?    This question, and its answers, culminate in the ambitious five by seven foot painting The Death of General Industry. The painting, part redux and part critique of Benjamin West’s iconic The Death of General Wolfe, depicts eleven male members of Canadian politics and industry standing in front of the Fort MacMurry oil refinery. A twelfth figure, laying wounded and dying in the arms of a laborer, is Francois-Phillipe Champagne—the current minister of innovation, science, and industry in Canada. Is it Champagne dying in the painting, is it his title, or is it what it represents? How can a country so transfixed on traditional masculinity innovate industry, or anything else for that matter?    Finally, the artist’s material and conceptual versatility is on display in his isolationist series of paintings. In works like Allein, Apochronal, and Wanderer, audiences are asked to examine the differences between being lonely and being alone, and to consider the philosophical impact of the distinctions between these two states of existence, the time one may spend in each state, and the influence each plays in the forming of a personal identity.    (Un)comfortably Numb is a personal investigation of identity, evolution, history, and development, as well as a critique of society’s preservation of traditional gender roles and their impact on individual expression. Arthurs places his works within a space where time is non-linear and indistinguishable; an environment akin to his own experience in dealing with his condition. As such, (Un)comfortably Numb transforms the gallery space into a state of contradiction in which the reality of past, present, and future is lost to the numbing stillness of being.    - By Zachary Scola-Allison    &nbsp;",

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology. His work has been exhibited across North America, from the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Colorado University Art Museum, with his work in public collections at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, York University and the de Young Museum in San Francisco, among others. Of his many accolades and awards, he is the recent recipient of the 2022 Gershon Iskowitz prize at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the 2023 Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts for Artistic Achievement.    With over 15 years of experience in the field of contemporary art and photography, Liz Ikiriko has delivered large-scale, complex projects, working closely with a variety of artists, organizations and institutions. She builds long-lasting connections with organizations, including Wedge Curatorial Projects, the National Music Centre, Critical Distance Centre for Curators and the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival. Ikiriko received her master of fine arts in criticism and curatorial practice from OCAD University, and has taught photography at Toronto Metropolitan University and Sheridan College. She has written for and worked on publications including Maclean’s, Public Journal, MICE Magazine, Blackflash, Akimbo, C Magazine and, most recently, contributed to Aperture’s As We Rise: Photography From the Black Atlantic. She is co-founder of the Ways of Attuning Curatorial Study Group, a member of the curatorial committee for the 13th Rencontres de Bamako, African Photography Biennial in Mali. She is the inaugural curator of collections and art in public space at the University of Toronto’s Art Museum and was the previous curator of collections and contemporary art engagement at the AGYU.

The overall goal of this interdisciplinary symposium is to consolidate and expand the state of knowledge regarding how social science and health scholars conduct research in ways that can help Black Canadian communities flourish.            The symposium will consist of two panels, followed by learning circles between the panelists and graduate students.  The panelists include Dr. Anthony Kwame Harrison, Dr. Alicia Boatswain-Kyte, Dr. Bukola Salami, Dr. Giselle Thompson, Dr. Tanya Matthews, Dr. Tya Collins, and others.  Lunch and snacks will be served.  RSVP at forms.gle/YzNkfgpZ8MGaFoDV7.

                "description": "(Un)comfortably Numb is a solo gallery exhibition by Colin Arthurs.    Location: Gales Gallery  Hours: 9 am to 5pm  Dates: October 30 to November 5  Reception: November 1 (6 pm to 9 pm)    Through artworks created across the mediums of painting, photography, and print, artist Colin Arthurs engages with contemporary constructions of disability, isolation, and masculinity to challenge and subvert modern conceptions of time, space, and identity. Having developed a nerve condition in his early teens that has left him without feeling in his arms and legs, Arthurs’ artworks explore the ways in which this diagnosis has altered aspects of his lifestyle and identity.    As a result of this condition, Arthurs has been deemed ineligible to follow in a long familial tradition of military service. In (Un)comfortably Numb, the artist confronts these unspoken expectations and lays bare the overwhelming struggle to assert one’s individuality and define an identity bereft of historical reciprocity. Works like Never Coming Home play with the uncomfortable complexity of expectation. While the portrait itself, a painted representation of a military headshot, is meant to immortalize the image of courage, pride, and tradition, the cool palette and title of the work situate the young subject in a numbing reality. Arthurs’ poignant portrait communicates a concept that too often becomes a truth; the overreliance on and dedication to preserving history often leads to the loss of a future. While Never Coming Home conveys this idea literally through the subject on the canvas, it also situates the artist and viewer in the conceptual realm of lost identity. Through an adept interaction between past and future, the works on display in (Un)comfortably Numb transcend traditional western boundaries of time and space.    The exhibit’s critical struggle with a traditional masculine identity is overtly explored through the artist’s stone lithograph series Peace was Never an Option and The Distinguished Gentleman. In yet another clever contradiction between subject and title, Arthurs offers an engaging analysis of “manliness” in Peace was Never an Option, a work depicting a male chicken sitting on the handle of an axe. Combining the historical symbolism of the chicken (cowardice and fear), the rooster (phallus and false bravado), and the axe (violence and sustenance), the artist deconstructs the false narrative of the man as a brave warrior and provider and questions this story’s role in contemporary society. The artwork asks the viewer what is more courageous, to blindly follow preconceived constructions of masculinity, or to refuse its enticing aura of acceptance and assurance?    This question, and its answers, culminate in the ambitious five by seven foot painting The Death of General Industry. The painting, part redux and part critique of Benjamin West’s iconic The Death of General Wolfe, depicts eleven male members of Canadian politics and industry standing in front of the Fort MacMurry oil refinery. A twelfth figure, laying wounded and dying in the arms of a laborer, is Francois-Phillipe Champagne—the current minister of innovation, science, and industry in Canada. Is it Champagne dying in the painting, is it his title, or is it what it represents? How can a country so transfixed on traditional masculinity innovate industry, or anything else for that matter?    Finally, the artist’s material and conceptual versatility is on display in his isolationist series of paintings. In works like Allein, Apochronal, and Wanderer, audiences are asked to examine the differences between being lonely and being alone, and to consider the philosophical impact of the distinctions between these two states of existence, the time one may spend in each state, and the influence each plays in the forming of a personal identity.    (Un)comfortably Numb is a personal investigation of identity, evolution, history, and development, as well as a critique of society’s preservation of traditional gender roles and their impact on individual expression. Arthurs places his works within a space where time is non-linear and indistinguishable; an environment akin to his own experience in dealing with his condition. As such, (Un)comfortably Numb transforms the gallery space into a state of contradiction in which the reality of past, present, and future is lost to the numbing stillness of being.    - By Zachary Scola-Allison    &nbsp;",

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology. His work has been exhibited across North America, from the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Colorado University Art Museum, with his work in public collections at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, York University and the de Young Museum in San Francisco, among others. Of his many accolades and awards, he is the recent recipient of the 2022 Gershon Iskowitz prize at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the 2023 Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts for Artistic Achievement.    With over 15 years of experience in the field of contemporary art and photography, Liz Ikiriko has delivered large-scale, complex projects, working closely with a variety of artists, organizations and institutions. She builds long-lasting connections with organizations, including Wedge Curatorial Projects, the National Music Centre, Critical Distance Centre for Curators and the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival. Ikiriko received her master of fine arts in criticism and curatorial practice from OCAD University, and has taught photography at Toronto Metropolitan University and Sheridan College. She has written for and worked on publications including Maclean’s, Public Journal, MICE Magazine, Blackflash, Akimbo, C Magazine and, most recently, contributed to Aperture’s As We Rise: Photography From the Black Atlantic. She is co-founder of the Ways of Attuning Curatorial Study Group, a member of the curatorial committee for the 13th Rencontres de Bamako, African Photography Biennial in Mali. She is the inaugural curator of collections and art in public space at the University of Toronto’s Art Museum and was the previous curator of collections and contemporary art engagement at the AGYU.

The overall goal of this interdisciplinary symposium is to consolidate and expand the state of knowledge regarding how social science and health scholars conduct research in ways that can help Black Canadian communities flourish.            The symposium will consist of two panels, followed by learning circles between the panelists and graduate students.  The panelists include Dr. Anthony Kwame Harrison, Dr. Alicia Boatswain-Kyte, Dr. Bukola Salami, Dr. Giselle Thompson, Dr. Tanya Matthews, Dr. Tya Collins, and others.  Lunch and snacks will be served.  RSVP at forms.gle/YzNkfgpZ8MGaFoDV7.

                "description": "(Un)comfortably Numb is a solo gallery exhibition by Colin Arthurs.    Location: Gales Gallery  Hours: 9 am to 5pm  Dates: October 30 to November 5  Reception: November 1 (6 pm to 9 pm)    Through artworks created across the mediums of painting, photography, and print, artist Colin Arthurs engages with contemporary constructions of disability, isolation, and masculinity to challenge and subvert modern conceptions of time, space, and identity. Having developed a nerve condition in his early teens that has left him without feeling in his arms and legs, Arthurs’ artworks explore the ways in which this diagnosis has altered aspects of his lifestyle and identity.    As a result of this condition, Arthurs has been deemed ineligible to follow in a long familial tradition of military service. In (Un)comfortably Numb, the artist confronts these unspoken expectations and lays bare the overwhelming struggle to assert one’s individuality and define an identity bereft of historical reciprocity. Works like Never Coming Home play with the uncomfortable complexity of expectation. While the portrait itself, a painted representation of a military headshot, is meant to immortalize the image of courage, pride, and tradition, the cool palette and title of the work situate the young subject in a numbing reality. Arthurs’ poignant portrait communicates a concept that too often becomes a truth; the overreliance on and dedication to preserving history often leads to the loss of a future. While Never Coming Home conveys this idea literally through the subject on the canvas, it also situates the artist and viewer in the conceptual realm of lost identity. Through an adept interaction between past and future, the works on display in (Un)comfortably Numb transcend traditional western boundaries of time and space.    The exhibit’s critical struggle with a traditional masculine identity is overtly explored through the artist’s stone lithograph series Peace was Never an Option and The Distinguished Gentleman. In yet another clever contradiction between subject and title, Arthurs offers an engaging analysis of “manliness” in Peace was Never an Option, a work depicting a male chicken sitting on the handle of an axe. Combining the historical symbolism of the chicken (cowardice and fear), the rooster (phallus and false bravado), and the axe (violence and sustenance), the artist deconstructs the false narrative of the man as a brave warrior and provider and questions this story’s role in contemporary society. The artwork asks the viewer what is more courageous, to blindly follow preconceived constructions of masculinity, or to refuse its enticing aura of acceptance and assurance?    This question, and its answers, culminate in the ambitious five by seven foot painting The Death of General Industry. The painting, part redux and part critique of Benjamin West’s iconic The Death of General Wolfe, depicts eleven male members of Canadian politics and industry standing in front of the Fort MacMurry oil refinery. A twelfth figure, laying wounded and dying in the arms of a laborer, is Francois-Phillipe Champagne—the current minister of innovation, science, and industry in Canada. Is it Champagne dying in the painting, is it his title, or is it what it represents? How can a country so transfixed on traditional masculinity innovate industry, or anything else for that matter?    Finally, the artist’s material and conceptual versatility is on display in his isolationist series of paintings. In works like Allein, Apochronal, and Wanderer, audiences are asked to examine the differences between being lonely and being alone, and to consider the philosophical impact of the distinctions between these two states of existence, the time one may spend in each state, and the influence each plays in the forming of a personal identity.    (Un)comfortably Numb is a personal investigation of identity, evolution, history, and development, as well as a critique of society’s preservation of traditional gender roles and their impact on individual expression. Arthurs places his works within a space where time is non-linear and indistinguishable; an environment akin to his own experience in dealing with his condition. As such, (Un)comfortably Numb transforms the gallery space into a state of contradiction in which the reality of past, present, and future is lost to the numbing stillness of being.    - By Zachary Scola-Allison    &nbsp;",

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology. His work has been exhibited across North America, from the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Colorado University Art Museum, with his work in public collections at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, York University and the de Young Museum in San Francisco, among others. Of his many accolades and awards, he is the recent recipient of the 2022 Gershon Iskowitz prize at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the 2023 Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts for Artistic Achievement.    With over 15 years of experience in the field of contemporary art and photography, Liz Ikiriko has delivered large-scale, complex projects, working closely with a variety of artists, organizations and institutions. She builds long-lasting connections with organizations, including Wedge Curatorial Projects, the National Music Centre, Critical Distance Centre for Curators and the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival. Ikiriko received her master of fine arts in criticism and curatorial practice from OCAD University, and has taught photography at Toronto Metropolitan University and Sheridan College. She has written for and worked on publications including Maclean’s, Public Journal, MICE Magazine, Blackflash, Akimbo, C Magazine and, most recently, contributed to Aperture’s As We Rise: Photography From the Black Atlantic. She is co-founder of the Ways of Attuning Curatorial Study Group, a member of the curatorial committee for the 13th Rencontres de Bamako, African Photography Biennial in Mali. She is the inaugural curator of collections and art in public space at the University of Toronto’s Art Museum and was the previous curator of collections and contemporary art engagement at the AGYU.

                "description": "                Since the death of George Floyd in May 2020, there have been several calls for research and grant proposals explicitly addressing the causes and effects of racialization and anti-Black racism. Meanwhile, the scholarly literature pertaining specifically to research involving Black Canadians is burgeoning but limited. The overall goal of this interdisciplinary symposium is to consolidate and expand the state of knowledge regarding how social science and health scholars conduct research in ways that can help Black Canadian communities flourish.            The symposium will consist of two panels, followed by learning circles between the panelists and graduate students.  The panelists include Dr. Anthony Kwame Harrison, Dr. Alicia Boatswain-Kyte, Dr. Bukola Salami, Dr. Giselle Thompson, Dr. Tanya Matthews, Dr. Tya Collins, and others.  Lunch and snacks will be served.  RSVP at forms.gle/YzNkfgpZ8MGaFoDV7.  This event is funded by a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Connection Grant and LA&amp;PS Research Events Fund.          ",

                "description": "(Un)comfortably Numb is a solo gallery exhibition by Colin Arthurs.    Location: Gales Gallery  Hours: 9 am to 5pm  Dates: October 30 to November 5  Reception: November 1 (6 pm to 9 pm)    Through artworks created across the mediums of painting, photography, and print, artist Colin Arthurs engages with contemporary constructions of disability, isolation, and masculinity to challenge and subvert modern conceptions of time, space, and identity. Having developed a nerve condition in his early teens that has left him without feeling in his arms and legs, Arthurs’ artworks explore the ways in which this diagnosis has altered aspects of his lifestyle and identity.    As a result of this condition, Arthurs has been deemed ineligible to follow in a long familial tradition of military service. In (Un)comfortably Numb, the artist confronts these unspoken expectations and lays bare the overwhelming struggle to assert one’s individuality and define an identity bereft of historical reciprocity. Works like Never Coming Home play with the uncomfortable complexity of expectation. While the portrait itself, a painted representation of a military headshot, is meant to immortalize the image of courage, pride, and tradition, the cool palette and title of the work situate the young subject in a numbing reality. Arthurs’ poignant portrait communicates a concept that too often becomes a truth; the overreliance on and dedication to preserving history often leads to the loss of a future. While Never Coming Home conveys this idea literally through the subject on the canvas, it also situates the artist and viewer in the conceptual realm of lost identity. Through an adept interaction between past and future, the works on display in (Un)comfortably Numb transcend traditional western boundaries of time and space.    The exhibit’s critical struggle with a traditional masculine identity is overtly explored through the artist’s stone lithograph series Peace was Never an Option and The Distinguished Gentleman. In yet another clever contradiction between subject and title, Arthurs offers an engaging analysis of “manliness” in Peace was Never an Option, a work depicting a male chicken sitting on the handle of an axe. Combining the historical symbolism of the chicken (cowardice and fear), the rooster (phallus and false bravado), and the axe (violence and sustenance), the artist deconstructs the false narrative of the man as a brave warrior and provider and questions this story’s role in contemporary society. The artwork asks the viewer what is more courageous, to blindly follow preconceived constructions of masculinity, or to refuse its enticing aura of acceptance and assurance?    This question, and its answers, culminate in the ambitious five by seven foot painting The Death of General Industry. The painting, part redux and part critique of Benjamin West’s iconic The Death of General Wolfe, depicts eleven male members of Canadian politics and industry standing in front of the Fort MacMurry oil refinery. A twelfth figure, laying wounded and dying in the arms of a laborer, is Francois-Phillipe Champagne—the current minister of innovation, science, and industry in Canada. Is it Champagne dying in the painting, is it his title, or is it what it represents? How can a country so transfixed on traditional masculinity innovate industry, or anything else for that matter?    Finally, the artist’s material and conceptual versatility is on display in his isolationist series of paintings. In works like Allein, Apochronal, and Wanderer, audiences are asked to examine the differences between being lonely and being alone, and to consider the philosophical impact of the distinctions between these two states of existence, the time one may spend in each state, and the influence each plays in the forming of a personal identity.    (Un)comfortably Numb is a personal investigation of identity, evolution, history, and development, as well as a critique of society’s preservation of traditional gender roles and their impact on individual expression. Arthurs places his works within a space where time is non-linear and indistinguishable; an environment akin to his own experience in dealing with his condition. As such, (Un)comfortably Numb transforms the gallery space into a state of contradiction in which the reality of past, present, and future is lost to the numbing stillness of being.    - By Zachary Scola-Allison    &nbsp;",

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology. His work has been exhibited across North America, from the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Colorado University Art Museum, with his work in public collections at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, York University and the de Young Museum in San Francisco, among others. Of his many accolades and awards, he is the recent recipient of the 2022 Gershon Iskowitz prize at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the 2023 Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts for Artistic Achievement.    With over 15 years of experience in the field of contemporary art and photography, Liz Ikiriko has delivered large-scale, complex projects, working closely with a variety of artists, organizations and institutions. She builds long-lasting connections with organizations, including Wedge Curatorial Projects, the National Music Centre, Critical Distance Centre for Curators and the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival. Ikiriko received her master of fine arts in criticism and curatorial practice from OCAD University, and has taught photography at Toronto Metropolitan University and Sheridan College. She has written for and worked on publications including Maclean’s, Public Journal, MICE Magazine, Blackflash, Akimbo, C Magazine and, most recently, contributed to Aperture’s As We Rise: Photography From the Black Atlantic. She is co-founder of the Ways of Attuning Curatorial Study Group, a member of the curatorial committee for the 13th Rencontres de Bamako, African Photography Biennial in Mali. She is the inaugural curator of collections and art in public space at the University of Toronto’s Art Museum and was the previous curator of collections and contemporary art engagement at the AGYU.

The Alchemy Lecture is a multi-vocal model that brings together a constellation of five thinkers and practitioners from different disciplines and geographies annually to think together and in public on the most pressing issues of our times. Each lecture will culminate in the publication of a book bearing the title of that year's convening in the new imprint, Alchemy by Knopf. Along with the inclusion of an introduction, each book will extend the public lecture and build on its alchemical form. These lectures (and the book that will result from them) speak into the interregnum of precipitous climate catastrophe and social and political reckoning.

Meanwhile, the scholarly literature pertaining specifically to research involving Black Canadians is burgeoning but limited. The overall goal of this interdisciplinary symposium is to consolidate and expand the state of knowledge regarding how social science and health scholars conduct research in ways that can help Black Canadian communities flourish.            The symposium will consist of two panels, followed by learning circles between the panelists and graduate students.  The panelists include Dr. Anthony Kwame Harrison, Dr. Alicia Boatswain-Kyte, Dr. Bukola Salami, Dr. Giselle Thompson, Dr. Tanya Matthews, Dr. Tya Collins, and others.  Lunch and snacks will be served.  RSVP at forms.gle/YzNkfgpZ8MGaFoDV7.

                "description": "(Un)comfortably Numb is a solo gallery exhibition by Colin Arthurs.    Location: Gales Gallery  Hours: 9 am to 5pm  Dates: October 30 to November 5  Reception: November 1 (6 pm to 9 pm)    Through artworks created across the mediums of painting, photography, and print, artist Colin Arthurs engages with contemporary constructions of disability, isolation, and masculinity to challenge and subvert modern conceptions of time, space, and identity. Having developed a nerve condition in his early teens that has left him without feeling in his arms and legs, Arthurs’ artworks explore the ways in which this diagnosis has altered aspects of his lifestyle and identity.    As a result of this condition, Arthurs has been deemed ineligible to follow in a long familial tradition of military service. In (Un)comfortably Numb, the artist confronts these unspoken expectations and lays bare the overwhelming struggle to assert one’s individuality and define an identity bereft of historical reciprocity. Works like Never Coming Home play with the uncomfortable complexity of expectation. While the portrait itself, a painted representation of a military headshot, is meant to immortalize the image of courage, pride, and tradition, the cool palette and title of the work situate the young subject in a numbing reality. Arthurs’ poignant portrait communicates a concept that too often becomes a truth; the overreliance on and dedication to preserving history often leads to the loss of a future. While Never Coming Home conveys this idea literally through the subject on the canvas, it also situates the artist and viewer in the conceptual realm of lost identity. Through an adept interaction between past and future, the works on display in (Un)comfortably Numb transcend traditional western boundaries of time and space.    The exhibit’s critical struggle with a traditional masculine identity is overtly explored through the artist’s stone lithograph series Peace was Never an Option and The Distinguished Gentleman. In yet another clever contradiction between subject and title, Arthurs offers an engaging analysis of “manliness” in Peace was Never an Option, a work depicting a male chicken sitting on the handle of an axe. Combining the historical symbolism of the chicken (cowardice and fear), the rooster (phallus and false bravado), and the axe (violence and sustenance), the artist deconstructs the false narrative of the man as a brave warrior and provider and questions this story’s role in contemporary society. The artwork asks the viewer what is more courageous, to blindly follow preconceived constructions of masculinity, or to refuse its enticing aura of acceptance and assurance?    This question, and its answers, culminate in the ambitious five by seven foot painting The Death of General Industry. The painting, part redux and part critique of Benjamin West’s iconic The Death of General Wolfe, depicts eleven male members of Canadian politics and industry standing in front of the Fort MacMurry oil refinery. A twelfth figure, laying wounded and dying in the arms of a laborer, is Francois-Phillipe Champagne—the current minister of innovation, science, and industry in Canada. Is it Champagne dying in the painting, is it his title, or is it what it represents? How can a country so transfixed on traditional masculinity innovate industry, or anything else for that matter?    Finally, the artist’s material and conceptual versatility is on display in his isolationist series of paintings. In works like Allein, Apochronal, and Wanderer, audiences are asked to examine the differences between being lonely and being alone, and to consider the philosophical impact of the distinctions between these two states of existence, the time one may spend in each state, and the influence each plays in the forming of a personal identity.    (Un)comfortably Numb is a personal investigation of identity, evolution, history, and development, as well as a critique of society’s preservation of traditional gender roles and their impact on individual expression. Arthurs places his works within a space where time is non-linear and indistinguishable; an environment akin to his own experience in dealing with his condition. As such, (Un)comfortably Numb transforms the gallery space into a state of contradiction in which the reality of past, present, and future is lost to the numbing stillness of being.    - By Zachary Scola-Allison    &nbsp;",

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology. His work has been exhibited across North America, from the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Colorado University Art Museum, with his work in public collections at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, York University and the de Young Museum in San Francisco, among others. Of his many accolades and awards, he is the recent recipient of the 2022 Gershon Iskowitz prize at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the 2023 Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts for Artistic Achievement.    With over 15 years of experience in the field of contemporary art and photography, Liz Ikiriko has delivered large-scale, complex projects, working closely with a variety of artists, organizations and institutions. She builds long-lasting connections with organizations, including Wedge Curatorial Projects, the National Music Centre, Critical Distance Centre for Curators and the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival. Ikiriko received her master of fine arts in criticism and curatorial practice from OCAD University, and has taught photography at Toronto Metropolitan University and Sheridan College. She has written for and worked on publications including Maclean’s, Public Journal, MICE Magazine, Blackflash, Akimbo, C Magazine and, most recently, contributed to Aperture’s As We Rise: Photography From the Black Atlantic. She is co-founder of the Ways of Attuning Curatorial Study Group, a member of the curatorial committee for the 13th Rencontres de Bamako, African Photography Biennial in Mali. She is the inaugural curator of collections and art in public space at the University of Toronto’s Art Museum and was the previous curator of collections and contemporary art engagement at the AGYU.

                "description": "(Un)comfortably Numb is a solo gallery exhibition by Colin Arthurs.    Location: Gales Gallery  Hours: 9 am to 5pm  Dates: October 30 to November 5  Reception: November 1 (6 pm to 9 pm)    Through artworks created across the mediums of painting, photography, and print, artist Colin Arthurs engages with contemporary constructions of disability, isolation, and masculinity to challenge and subvert modern conceptions of time, space, and identity. Having developed a nerve condition in his early teens that has left him without feeling in his arms and legs, Arthurs’ artworks explore the ways in which this diagnosis has altered aspects of his lifestyle and identity.    As a result of this condition, Arthurs has been deemed ineligible to follow in a long familial tradition of military service. In (Un)comfortably Numb, the artist confronts these unspoken expectations and lays bare the overwhelming struggle to assert one’s individuality and define an identity bereft of historical reciprocity. Works like Never Coming Home play with the uncomfortable complexity of expectation. While the portrait itself, a painted representation of a military headshot, is meant to immortalize the image of courage, pride, and tradition, the cool palette and title of the work situate the young subject in a numbing reality. Arthurs’ poignant portrait communicates a concept that too often becomes a truth; the overreliance on and dedication to preserving history often leads to the loss of a future. While Never Coming Home conveys this idea literally through the subject on the canvas, it also situates the artist and viewer in the conceptual realm of lost identity. Through an adept interaction between past and future, the works on display in (Un)comfortably Numb transcend traditional western boundaries of time and space.    The exhibit’s critical struggle with a traditional masculine identity is overtly explored through the artist’s stone lithograph series Peace was Never an Option and The Distinguished Gentleman. In yet another clever contradiction between subject and title, Arthurs offers an engaging analysis of “manliness” in Peace was Never an Option, a work depicting a male chicken sitting on the handle of an axe. Combining the historical symbolism of the chicken (cowardice and fear), the rooster (phallus and false bravado), and the axe (violence and sustenance), the artist deconstructs the false narrative of the man as a brave warrior and provider and questions this story’s role in contemporary society. The artwork asks the viewer what is more courageous, to blindly follow preconceived constructions of masculinity, or to refuse its enticing aura of acceptance and assurance?    This question, and its answers, culminate in the ambitious five by seven foot painting The Death of General Industry. The painting, part redux and part critique of Benjamin West’s iconic The Death of General Wolfe, depicts eleven male members of Canadian politics and industry standing in front of the Fort MacMurry oil refinery. A twelfth figure, laying wounded and dying in the arms of a laborer, is Francois-Phillipe Champagne—the current minister of innovation, science, and industry in Canada. Is it Champagne dying in the painting, is it his title, or is it what it represents? How can a country so transfixed on traditional masculinity innovate industry, or anything else for that matter?    Finally, the artist’s material and conceptual versatility is on display in his isolationist series of paintings. In works like Allein, Apochronal, and Wanderer, audiences are asked to examine the differences between being lonely and being alone, and to consider the philosophical impact of the distinctions between these two states of existence, the time one may spend in each state, and the influence each plays in the forming of a personal identity.    (Un)comfortably Numb is a personal investigation of identity, evolution, history, and development, as well as a critique of society’s preservation of traditional gender roles and their impact on individual expression. Arthurs places his works within a space where time is non-linear and indistinguishable; an environment akin to his own experience in dealing with his condition. As such, (Un)comfortably Numb transforms the gallery space into a state of contradiction in which the reality of past, present, and future is lost to the numbing stillness of being.    - By Zachary Scola-Allison    &nbsp;",

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology. His work has been exhibited across North America, from the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Colorado University Art Museum, with his work in public collections at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, York University and the de Young Museum in San Francisco, among others. Of his many accolades and awards, he is the recent recipient of the 2022 Gershon Iskowitz prize at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the 2023 Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts for Artistic Achievement.    With over 15 years of experience in the field of contemporary art and photography, Liz Ikiriko has delivered large-scale, complex projects, working closely with a variety of artists, organizations and institutions. She builds long-lasting connections with organizations, including Wedge Curatorial Projects, the National Music Centre, Critical Distance Centre for Curators and the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival. Ikiriko received her master of fine arts in criticism and curatorial practice from OCAD University, and has taught photography at Toronto Metropolitan University and Sheridan College. She has written for and worked on publications including Maclean’s, Public Journal, MICE Magazine, Blackflash, Akimbo, C Magazine and, most recently, contributed to Aperture’s As We Rise: Photography From the Black Atlantic. She is co-founder of the Ways of Attuning Curatorial Study Group, a member of the curatorial committee for the 13th Rencontres de Bamako, African Photography Biennial in Mali. She is the inaugural curator of collections and art in public space at the University of Toronto’s Art Museum and was the previous curator of collections and contemporary art engagement at the AGYU.

                "description": "                Since the death of George Floyd in May 2020, there have been several calls for research and grant proposals explicitly addressing the causes and effects of racialization and anti-Black racism. Meanwhile, the scholarly literature pertaining specifically to research involving Black Canadians is burgeoning but limited. The overall goal of this interdisciplinary symposium is to consolidate and expand the state of knowledge regarding how social science and health scholars conduct research in ways that can help Black Canadian communities flourish.            The symposium will consist of two panels, followed by learning circles between the panelists and graduate students.  The panelists include Dr. Anthony Kwame Harrison, Dr. Alicia Boatswain-Kyte, Dr. Bukola Salami, Dr. Giselle Thompson, Dr. Tanya Matthews, Dr. Tya Collins, and others.  Lunch and snacks will be served.  RSVP at forms.gle/YzNkfgpZ8MGaFoDV7.

                "description": "(Un)comfortably Numb is a solo gallery exhibition by Colin Arthurs.    Location: Gales Gallery  Hours: 9 am to 5pm  Dates: October 30 to November 5  Reception: November 1 (6 pm to 9 pm)    Through artworks created across the mediums of painting, photography, and print, artist Colin Arthurs engages with contemporary constructions of disability, isolation, and masculinity to challenge and subvert modern conceptions of time, space, and identity. Having developed a nerve condition in his early teens that has left him without feeling in his arms and legs, Arthurs’ artworks explore the ways in which this diagnosis has altered aspects of his lifestyle and identity.    As a result of this condition, Arthurs has been deemed ineligible to follow in a long familial tradition of military service. In (Un)comfortably Numb, the artist confronts these unspoken expectations and lays bare the overwhelming struggle to assert one’s individuality and define an identity bereft of historical reciprocity. Works like Never Coming Home play with the uncomfortable complexity of expectation. While the portrait itself, a painted representation of a military headshot, is meant to immortalize the image of courage, pride, and tradition, the cool palette and title of the work situate the young subject in a numbing reality. Arthurs’ poignant portrait communicates a concept that too often becomes a truth; the overreliance on and dedication to preserving history often leads to the loss of a future. While Never Coming Home conveys this idea literally through the subject on the canvas, it also situates the artist and viewer in the conceptual realm of lost identity. Through an adept interaction between past and future, the works on display in (Un)comfortably Numb transcend traditional western boundaries of time and space.    The exhibit’s critical struggle with a traditional masculine identity is overtly explored through the artist’s stone lithograph series Peace was Never an Option and The Distinguished Gentleman. In yet another clever contradiction between subject and title, Arthurs offers an engaging analysis of “manliness” in Peace was Never an Option, a work depicting a male chicken sitting on the handle of an axe. Combining the historical symbolism of the chicken (cowardice and fear), the rooster (phallus and false bravado), and the axe (violence and sustenance), the artist deconstructs the false narrative of the man as a brave warrior and provider and questions this story’s role in contemporary society. The artwork asks the viewer what is more courageous, to blindly follow preconceived constructions of masculinity, or to refuse its enticing aura of acceptance and assurance?    This question, and its answers, culminate in the ambitious five by seven foot painting The Death of General Industry. The painting, part redux and part critique of Benjamin West’s iconic The Death of General Wolfe, depicts eleven male members of Canadian politics and industry standing in front of the Fort MacMurry oil refinery. A twelfth figure, laying wounded and dying in the arms of a laborer, is Francois-Phillipe Champagne—the current minister of innovation, science, and industry in Canada. Is it Champagne dying in the painting, is it his title, or is it what it represents? How can a country so transfixed on traditional masculinity innovate industry, or anything else for that matter?    Finally, the artist’s material and conceptual versatility is on display in his isolationist series of paintings. In works like Allein, Apochronal, and Wanderer, audiences are asked to examine the differences between being lonely and being alone, and to consider the philosophical impact of the distinctions between these two states of existence, the time one may spend in each state, and the influence each plays in the forming of a personal identity.    (Un)comfortably Numb is a personal investigation of identity, evolution, history, and development, as well as a critique of society’s preservation of traditional gender roles and their impact on individual expression. Arthurs places his works within a space where time is non-linear and indistinguishable; an environment akin to his own experience in dealing with his condition. As such, (Un)comfortably Numb transforms the gallery space into a state of contradiction in which the reality of past, present, and future is lost to the numbing stillness of being.    - By Zachary Scola-Allison    &nbsp;",

                "description": "                Since the death of George Floyd in May 2020, there have been several calls for research and grant proposals explicitly addressing the causes and effects of racialization and anti-Black racism. Meanwhile, the scholarly literature pertaining specifically to research involving Black Canadians is burgeoning but limited. The overall goal of this interdisciplinary symposium is to consolidate and expand the state of knowledge regarding how social science and health scholars conduct research in ways that can help Black Canadian communities flourish.            The symposium will consist of two panels, followed by learning circles between the panelists and graduate students.  The panelists include Dr. Anthony Kwame Harrison, Dr. Alicia Boatswain-Kyte, Dr. Bukola Salami, Dr. Giselle Thompson, Dr. Tanya Matthews, Dr. Tya Collins, and others.  Lunch and snacks will be served.  RSVP at forms.gle/YzNkfgpZ8MGaFoDV7.  This event is funded by a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Connection Grant and LA&amp;PS Research Events Fund.          ",

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology.

                "description": "                Since the death of George Floyd in May 2020, there have been several calls for research and grant proposals explicitly addressing the causes and effects of racialization and anti-Black racism. Meanwhile, the scholarly literature pertaining specifically to research involving Black Canadians is burgeoning but limited. The overall goal of this interdisciplinary symposium is to consolidate and expand the state of knowledge regarding how social science and health scholars conduct research in ways that can help Black Canadian communities flourish.            The symposium will consist of two panels, followed by learning circles between the panelists and graduate students.  The panelists include Dr. Anthony Kwame Harrison, Dr. Alicia Boatswain-Kyte, Dr. Bukola Salami, Dr. Giselle Thompson, Dr. Tanya Matthews, Dr. Tya Collins, and others.  Lunch and snacks will be served.  RSVP at forms.gle/YzNkfgpZ8MGaFoDV7.  This event is funded by a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Connection Grant and LA&amp;PS Research Events Fund.          ",

                "description": "Bearing Witness centres the stories of graduate students who have encountered harassment online in response to their research and seeks to shine a light on experiences that are rarely acknowledged or documented. Over the course of several months, the Bearing Witness team gathered stories from graduate students at York regarding their encounters with research harassment. Anonymized interview transcripts were then shared with artist-researchers, who are also students at York, to create research creation pieces that shine a light on the experiences of their peers  In November 2023, the Bearing Witness project will culminate in a one-day symposium on research harassment. The symposium will include a keynote address by Antonia Vaughan (University of Bath), panel discussions that approach the issue of research harassment from student, staff and faculty perspectives, and a screening of the documentary film.  Schedule for the day:        10:00 - 11:00 AM - Documentary Film Screening - Nat Taylor Cinema (Vari Hall)    11:00 - 12:00 Artist Statements and - Keynote Speech - Media Creation Lab (Scott Library)    1:15 - 2:30 PM - Panel 1: What should students know? - 280N Kaneff Tower    2:30 - 3:45 PM - Panel 2: What should the institution know? - 280N Kaneff Tower    3:45 - 4:00 PM - Break    4:00 - 5:00 PM - Session 3: Reflection Period and Closing Remarks - 280N Kaneff Tower    Click here to register for one or more of the day's sessions or the full event.

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology. His work has been exhibited across North America, from the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Colorado University Art Museum, with his work in public collections at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, York University and the de Young Museum in San Francisco, among others. Of his many accolades and awards, he is the recent recipient of the 2022 Gershon Iskowitz prize at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the 2023 Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts for Artistic Achievement.    With over 15 years of experience in the field of contemporary art and photography, Liz Ikiriko has delivered large-scale, complex projects, working closely with a variety of artists, organizations and institutions. She builds long-lasting connections with organizations, including Wedge Curatorial Projects, the National Music Centre, Critical Distance Centre for Curators and the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival. Ikiriko received her master of fine arts in criticism and curatorial practice from OCAD University, and has taught photography at Toronto Metropolitan University and Sheridan College. She has written for and worked on publications including Maclean’s, Public Journal, MICE Magazine, Blackflash, Akimbo, C Magazine and, most recently, contributed to Aperture’s As We Rise: Photography From the Black Atlantic. She is co-founder of the Ways of Attuning Curatorial Study Group, a member of the curatorial committee for the 13th Rencontres de Bamako, African Photography Biennial in Mali. She is the inaugural curator of collections and art in public space at the University of Toronto’s Art Museum and was the previous curator of collections and contemporary art engagement at the AGYU.

                "description": "                Since the death of George Floyd in May 2020, there have been several calls for research and grant proposals explicitly addressing the causes and effects of racialization and anti-Black racism. Meanwhile, the scholarly literature pertaining specifically to research involving Black Canadians is burgeoning but limited. The overall goal of this interdisciplinary symposium is to consolidate and expand the state of knowledge regarding how social science and health scholars conduct research in ways that can help Black Canadian communities flourish.            The symposium will consist of two panels, followed by learning circles between the panelists and graduate students.  The panelists include Dr. Anthony Kwame Harrison, Dr. Alicia Boatswain-Kyte, Dr. Bukola Salami, Dr. Giselle Thompson, Dr. Tanya Matthews, Dr. Tya Collins, and others.  Lunch and snacks will be served.  RSVP at forms.gle/YzNkfgpZ8MGaFoDV7.  This event is funded by a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Connection Grant and LA&amp;PS Research Events Fund.          ",

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology. His work has been exhibited across North America, from the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Colorado University Art Museum, with his work in public collections at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, York University and the de Young Museum in San Francisco, among others. Of his many accolades and awards, he is the recent recipient of the 2022 Gershon Iskowitz prize at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the 2023 Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts for Artistic Achievement.    With over 15 years of experience in the field of contemporary art and photography, Liz Ikiriko has delivered large-scale, complex projects, working closely with a variety of artists, organizations and institutions. She builds long-lasting connections with organizations, including Wedge Curatorial Projects, the National Music Centre, Critical Distance Centre for Curators and the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival. Ikiriko received her master of fine arts in criticism and curatorial practice from OCAD University, and has taught photography at Toronto Metropolitan University and Sheridan College. She has written for and worked on publications including Maclean’s, Public Journal, MICE Magazine, Blackflash, Akimbo, C Magazine and, most recently, contributed to Aperture’s As We Rise: Photography From the Black Atlantic. She is co-founder of the Ways of Attuning Curatorial Study Group, a member of the curatorial committee for the 13th Rencontres de Bamako, African Photography Biennial in Mali. She is the inaugural curator of collections and art in public space at the University of Toronto’s Art Museum and was the previous curator of collections and contemporary art engagement at the AGYU.

Did you know that postsecondary age young adults have the highest rates of substance use compared to all other age groups? Substance use and the reasons individuals choose to use various substances is different for everyone. And though there is no “safe” level of substance use, as use of any substance always carries some risk, there are steps that can be taken in attempt to reduce harms starting with education. In this workshop, we will: Introduce the different types of substances, prevalence, their uses, and how they impact health; discuss the risks associated with mixing various substances; and provide basic harm reduction strategies and resources.     Please note the purpose of this workshop is for general education guidelines only. We do not condone or promote any particular lifestyle choice.

                "description": "                Since the death of George Floyd in May 2020, there have been several calls for research and grant proposals explicitly addressing the causes and effects of racialization and anti-Black racism. Meanwhile, the scholarly literature pertaining specifically to research involving Black Canadians is burgeoning but limited. The overall goal of this interdisciplinary symposium is to consolidate and expand the state of knowledge regarding how social science and health scholars conduct research in ways that can help Black Canadian communities flourish.            The symposium will consist of two panels, followed by learning circles between the panelists and graduate students.  The panelists include Dr. Anthony Kwame Harrison, Dr. Alicia Boatswain-Kyte, Dr. Bukola Salami, Dr. Giselle Thompson, Dr. Tanya Matthews, Dr. Tya Collins, and others.  Lunch and snacks will be served.  RSVP at forms.gle/YzNkfgpZ8MGaFoDV7.  This event is funded by a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Connection Grant and LA&amp;PS Research Events Fund.          ",

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology. His work has been exhibited across North America, from the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Colorado University Art Museum, with his work in public collections at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, York University and the de Young Museum in San Francisco, among others. Of his many accolades and awards, he is the recent recipient of the 2022 Gershon Iskowitz prize at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the 2023 Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts for Artistic Achievement.    With over 15 years of experience in the field of contemporary art and photography, Liz Ikiriko has delivered large-scale, complex projects, working closely with a variety of artists, organizations and institutions. She builds long-lasting connections with organizations, including Wedge Curatorial Projects, the National Music Centre, Critical Distance Centre for Curators and the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival. Ikiriko received her master of fine arts in criticism and curatorial practice from OCAD University, and has taught photography at Toronto Metropolitan University and Sheridan College. She has written for and worked on publications including Maclean’s, Public Journal, MICE Magazine, Blackflash, Akimbo, C Magazine and, most recently, contributed to Aperture’s As We Rise: Photography From the Black Atlantic. She is co-founder of the Ways of Attuning Curatorial Study Group, a member of the curatorial committee for the 13th Rencontres de Bamako, African Photography Biennial in Mali. She is the inaugural curator of collections and art in public space at the University of Toronto’s Art Museum and was the previous curator of collections and contemporary art engagement at the AGYU.

                "description": "                Since the death of George Floyd in May 2020, there have been several calls for research and grant proposals explicitly addressing the causes and effects of racialization and anti-Black racism. Meanwhile, the scholarly literature pertaining specifically to research involving Black Canadians is burgeoning but limited. The overall goal of this interdisciplinary symposium is to consolidate and expand the state of knowledge regarding how social science and health scholars conduct research in ways that can help Black Canadian communities flourish.            The symposium will consist of two panels, followed by learning circles between the panelists and graduate students.  The panelists include Dr. Anthony Kwame Harrison, Dr. Alicia Boatswain-Kyte, Dr. Bukola Salami, Dr. Giselle Thompson, Dr. Tanya Matthews, Dr. Tya Collins, and others.  Lunch and snacks will be served.  RSVP at forms.gle/YzNkfgpZ8MGaFoDV7.  This event is funded by a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Connection Grant and LA&amp;PS Research Events Fund.          ",

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology. His work has been exhibited across North America, from the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Colorado University Art Museum, with his work in public collections at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, York University and the de Young Museum in San Francisco, among others. Of his many accolades and awards, he is the recent recipient of the 2022 Gershon Iskowitz prize at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the 2023 Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts for Artistic Achievement.    With over 15 years of experience in the field of contemporary art and photography, Liz Ikiriko has delivered large-scale, complex projects, working closely with a variety of artists, organizations and institutions. She builds long-lasting connections with organizations, including Wedge Curatorial Projects, the National Music Centre, Critical Distance Centre for Curators and the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival. Ikiriko received her master of fine arts in criticism and curatorial practice from OCAD University, and has taught photography at Toronto Metropolitan University and Sheridan College. She has written for and worked on publications including Maclean’s, Public Journal, MICE Magazine, Blackflash, Akimbo, C Magazine and, most recently, contributed to Aperture’s As We Rise: Photography From the Black Atlantic. She is co-founder of the Ways of Attuning Curatorial Study Group, a member of the curatorial committee for the 13th Rencontres de Bamako, African Photography Biennial in Mali. She is the inaugural curator of collections and art in public space at the University of Toronto’s Art Museum and was the previous curator of collections and contemporary art engagement at the AGYU.

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology. His work has been exhibited across North America, from the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Colorado University Art Museum, with his work in public collections at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, York University and the de Young Museum in San Francisco, among others. Of his many accolades and awards, he is the recent recipient of the 2022 Gershon Iskowitz prize at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the 2023 Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts for Artistic Achievement.    With over 15 years of experience in the field of contemporary art and photography, Liz Ikiriko has delivered large-scale, complex projects, working closely with a variety of artists, organizations and institutions. She builds long-lasting connections with organizations, including Wedge Curatorial Projects, the National Music Centre, Critical Distance Centre for Curators and the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival. Ikiriko received her master of fine arts in criticism and curatorial practice from OCAD University, and has taught photography at Toronto Metropolitan University and Sheridan College. She has written for and worked on publications including Maclean’s, Public Journal, MICE Magazine, Blackflash, Akimbo, C Magazine and, most recently, contributed to Aperture’s As We Rise: Photography From the Black Atlantic. She is co-founder of the Ways of Attuning Curatorial Study Group, a member of the curatorial committee for the 13th Rencontres de Bamako, African Photography Biennial in Mali. She is the inaugural curator of collections and art in public space at the University of Toronto’s Art Museum and was the previous curator of collections and contemporary art engagement at the AGYU.

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).

                "description": "When a person is striving to achieve perfection, they end up having a high standard to the point where even the thought of getting started brings up feelings of fear and anxiety.      A person who struggles with a dilemma uses procrastination as a protective mechanism to avoid the possibility of failing because they’ve internalized a perfect view of themselves and want to protect themselves from not achieving that view. Even though this type of person has a high need to succeed, they also have a high fear of failure making it more likely to procrastinate on a task.     If you can relate to this too, join the Health Education &amp; Promotion team as we:       Look at what Perfectionism and Procrastination are, their underlying factors and how the two relate to one another.     Explore ways to combat both perfectionism and procrastination, the discussion will include all or nothing thinking, receiving criticism and the practice of self-kindness.

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology. His work has been exhibited across North America, from the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Colorado University Art Museum, with his work in public collections at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, York University and the de Young Museum in San Francisco, among others. Of his many accolades and awards, he is the recent recipient of the 2022 Gershon Iskowitz prize at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the 2023 Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts for Artistic Achievement.    With over 15 years of experience in the field of contemporary art and photography, Liz Ikiriko has delivered large-scale, complex projects, working closely with a variety of artists, organizations and institutions. She builds long-lasting connections with organizations, including Wedge Curatorial Projects, the National Music Centre, Critical Distance Centre for Curators and the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival. Ikiriko received her master of fine arts in criticism and curatorial practice from OCAD University, and has taught photography at Toronto Metropolitan University and Sheridan College. She has written for and worked on publications including Maclean’s, Public Journal, MICE Magazine, Blackflash, Akimbo, C Magazine and, most recently, contributed to Aperture’s As We Rise: Photography From the Black Atlantic. She is co-founder of the Ways of Attuning Curatorial Study Group, a member of the curatorial committee for the 13th Rencontres de Bamako, African Photography Biennial in Mali. She is the inaugural curator of collections and art in public space at the University of Toronto’s Art Museum and was the previous curator of collections and contemporary art engagement at the AGYU.

Meanwhile, the scholarly literature pertaining specifically to research involving Black Canadians is burgeoning but limited. The overall goal of this interdisciplinary symposium is to consolidate and expand the state of knowledge regarding how social science and health scholars conduct research in ways that can help Black Canadian communities flourish.            The symposium will consist of two panels, followed by learning circles between the panelists and graduate students.  The panelists include Dr. Anthony Kwame Harrison, Dr. Alicia Boatswain-Kyte, Dr. Bukola Salami, Dr. Giselle Thompson, Dr. Tanya Matthews, Dr. Tya Collins, and others.  Lunch and snacks will be served.  RSVP at forms.gle/YzNkfgpZ8MGaFoDV7.  This event is funded by a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Connection Grant and LA&amp;PS Research Events Fund.          ",

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology. His work has been exhibited across North America, from the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Colorado University Art Museum, with his work in public collections at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, York University and the de Young Museum in San Francisco, among others. Of his many accolades and awards, he is the recent recipient of the 2022 Gershon Iskowitz prize at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the 2023 Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts for Artistic Achievement.    With over 15 years of experience in the field of contemporary art and photography, Liz Ikiriko has delivered large-scale, complex projects, working closely with a variety of artists, organizations and institutions. She builds long-lasting connections with organizations, including Wedge Curatorial Projects, the National Music Centre, Critical Distance Centre for Curators and the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival. Ikiriko received her master of fine arts in criticism and curatorial practice from OCAD University, and has taught photography at Toronto Metropolitan University and Sheridan College. She has written for and worked on publications including Maclean’s, Public Journal, MICE Magazine, Blackflash, Akimbo, C Magazine and, most recently, contributed to Aperture’s As We Rise: Photography From the Black Atlantic. She is co-founder of the Ways of Attuning Curatorial Study Group, a member of the curatorial committee for the 13th Rencontres de Bamako, African Photography Biennial in Mali. She is the inaugural curator of collections and art in public space at the University of Toronto’s Art Museum and was the previous curator of collections and contemporary art engagement at the AGYU.

                "description": "                Since the death of George Floyd in May 2020, there have been several calls for research and grant proposals explicitly addressing the causes and effects of racialization and anti-Black racism. Meanwhile, the scholarly literature pertaining specifically to research involving Black Canadians is burgeoning but limited. The overall goal of this interdisciplinary symposium is to consolidate and expand the state of knowledge regarding how social science and health scholars conduct research in ways that can help Black Canadian communities flourish.            The symposium will consist of two panels, followed by learning circles between the panelists and graduate students.  The panelists include Dr. Anthony Kwame Harrison, Dr. Alicia Boatswain-Kyte, Dr. Bukola Salami, Dr. Giselle Thompson, Dr. Tanya Matthews, Dr. Tya Collins, and others.  Lunch and snacks will be served.  RSVP at forms.gle/YzNkfgpZ8MGaFoDV7.  This event is funded by a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Connection Grant and LA&amp;PS Research Events Fund.          ",

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology.

Meanwhile, the scholarly literature pertaining specifically to research involving Black Canadians is burgeoning but limited. The overall goal of this interdisciplinary symposium is to consolidate and expand the state of knowledge regarding how social science and health scholars conduct research in ways that can help Black Canadian communities flourish.            The symposium will consist of two panels, followed by learning circles between the panelists and graduate students.

                "description": "    Destination: Mexico    Duration: June 17th – June 21st, 2024    This course introduces students to the practical implications of a continental free trade through immersive experiences in Southern Ontario and Central Mexico. Students taking part will be enrolled at either York University or the National Autonomous University of Mexico.

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology. His work has been exhibited across North America, from the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Colorado University Art Museum, with his work in public collections at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, York University and the de Young Museum in San Francisco, among others. Of his many accolades and awards, he is the recent recipient of the 2022 Gershon Iskowitz prize at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the 2023 Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts for Artistic Achievement.    With over 15 years of experience in the field of contemporary art and photography, Liz Ikiriko has delivered large-scale, complex projects, working closely with a variety of artists, organizations and institutions. She builds long-lasting connections with organizations, including Wedge Curatorial Projects, the National Music Centre, Critical Distance Centre for Curators and the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival. Ikiriko received her master of fine arts in criticism and curatorial practice from OCAD University, and has taught photography at Toronto Metropolitan University and Sheridan College. She has written for and worked on publications including Maclean’s, Public Journal, MICE Magazine, Blackflash, Akimbo, C Magazine and, most recently, contributed to Aperture’s As We Rise: Photography From the Black Atlantic. She is co-founder of the Ways of Attuning Curatorial Study Group, a member of the curatorial committee for the 13th Rencontres de Bamako, African Photography Biennial in Mali. She is the inaugural curator of collections and art in public space at the University of Toronto’s Art Museum and was the previous curator of collections and contemporary art engagement at the AGYU.

                "description": "                Since the death of George Floyd in May 2020, there have been several calls for research and grant proposals explicitly addressing the causes and effects of racialization and anti-Black racism. Meanwhile, the scholarly literature pertaining specifically to research involving Black Canadians is burgeoning but limited. The overall goal of this interdisciplinary symposium is to consolidate and expand the state of knowledge regarding how social science and health scholars conduct research in ways that can help Black Canadian communities flourish.            The symposium will consist of two panels, followed by learning circles between the panelists and graduate students.  The panelists include Dr. Anthony Kwame Harrison, Dr. Alicia Boatswain-Kyte, Dr. Bukola Salami, Dr. Giselle Thompson, Dr. Tanya Matthews, Dr. Tya Collins, and others.  Lunch and snacks will be served.  RSVP at forms.gle/YzNkfgpZ8MGaFoDV7.  This event is funded by a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Connection Grant and LA&amp;PS Research Events Fund.          ",

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology. His work has been exhibited across North America, from the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Colorado University Art Museum, with his work in public collections at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, York University and the de Young Museum in San Francisco, among others. Of his many accolades and awards, he is the recent recipient of the 2022 Gershon Iskowitz prize at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the 2023 Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts for Artistic Achievement.    With over 15 years of experience in the field of contemporary art and photography, Liz Ikiriko has delivered large-scale, complex projects, working closely with a variety of artists, organizations and institutions. She builds long-lasting connections with organizations, including Wedge Curatorial Projects, the National Music Centre, Critical Distance Centre for Curators and the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival. Ikiriko received her master of fine arts in criticism and curatorial practice from OCAD University, and has taught photography at Toronto Metropolitan University and Sheridan College. She has written for and worked on publications including Maclean’s, Public Journal, MICE Magazine, Blackflash, Akimbo, C Magazine and, most recently, contributed to Aperture’s As We Rise: Photography From the Black Atlantic. She is co-founder of the Ways of Attuning Curatorial Study Group, a member of the curatorial committee for the 13th Rencontres de Bamako, African Photography Biennial in Mali. She is the inaugural curator of collections and art in public space at the University of Toronto’s Art Museum and was the previous curator of collections and contemporary art engagement at the AGYU.

Meanwhile, the scholarly literature pertaining specifically to research involving Black Canadians is burgeoning but limited. The overall goal of this interdisciplinary symposium is to consolidate and expand the state of knowledge regarding how social science and health scholars conduct research in ways that can help Black Canadian communities flourish.            The symposium will consist of two panels, followed by learning circles between the panelists and graduate students.  The panelists include Dr. Anthony Kwame Harrison, Dr. Alicia Boatswain-Kyte, Dr. Bukola Salami, Dr. Giselle Thompson, Dr. Tanya Matthews, Dr. Tya Collins, and others.  Lunch and snacks will be served.  RSVP at forms.gle/YzNkfgpZ8MGaFoDV7.

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University.

                "description": "A new version by Anne Carson  “Euripides was a playwright of the fifth century BC who reinvented Greek tragedy, setting it on a path that leads straight to reality TV. His plays broke all the rules, upended convention and outraged conservative critics. The Bakkhai is his most subversive play, telling the story of a man who cannot admit he would rather live in the skin of a woman, and a god who seems to combine all sexualities into a single ruinous demand for adoration. Dionysos is the god of intoxication. Once you fall under his influence, there is no telling where you will end up.” - Anne Carson    Directed by David Jansen  Produced and Designed by York University Theatre Production and Design students    LOCATION  Joseph G.

Meanwhile, the scholarly literature pertaining specifically to research involving Black Canadians is burgeoning but limited. The overall goal of this interdisciplinary symposium is to consolidate and expand the state of knowledge regarding how social science and health scholars conduct research in ways that can help Black Canadian communities flourish.            The symposium will consist of two panels, followed by learning circles between the panelists and graduate students.  The panelists include Dr. Anthony Kwame Harrison, Dr. Alicia Boatswain-Kyte, Dr. Bukola Salami, Dr. Giselle Thompson, Dr. Tanya Matthews, Dr. Tya Collins, and others.  Lunch and snacks will be served.  RSVP at forms.gle/YzNkfgpZ8MGaFoDV7.

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology. His work has been exhibited across North America, from the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Colorado University Art Museum, with his work in public collections at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, York University and the de Young Museum in San Francisco, among others. Of his many accolades and awards, he is the recent recipient of the 2022 Gershon Iskowitz prize at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the 2023 Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts for Artistic Achievement.    With over 15 years of experience in the field of contemporary art and photography, Liz Ikiriko has delivered large-scale, complex projects, working closely with a variety of artists, organizations and institutions. She builds long-lasting connections with organizations, including Wedge Curatorial Projects, the National Music Centre, Critical Distance Centre for Curators and the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival. Ikiriko received her master of fine arts in criticism and curatorial practice from OCAD University, and has taught photography at Toronto Metropolitan University and Sheridan College. She has written for and worked on publications including Maclean’s, Public Journal, MICE Magazine, Blackflash, Akimbo, C Magazine and, most recently, contributed to Aperture’s As We Rise: Photography From the Black Atlantic. She is co-founder of the Ways of Attuning Curatorial Study Group, a member of the curatorial committee for the 13th Rencontres de Bamako, African Photography Biennial in Mali.

The Bakkhai is his most subversive play, telling the story of a man who cannot admit he would rather live in the skin of a woman, and a god who seems to combine all sexualities into a single ruinous demand for adoration. Dionysos is the god of intoxication. Once you fall under his influence, there is no telling where you will end up.” - Anne Carson    Directed by David Jansen  Produced and Designed by York University Theatre Production and Design students    LOCATION  Joseph G.

                "description": "                Since the death of George Floyd in May 2020, there have been several calls for research and grant proposals explicitly addressing the causes and effects of racialization and anti-Black racism. Meanwhile, the scholarly literature pertaining specifically to research involving Black Canadians is burgeoning but limited. The overall goal of this interdisciplinary symposium is to consolidate and expand the state of knowledge regarding how social science and health scholars conduct research in ways that can help Black Canadian communities flourish.            The symposium will consist of two panels, followed by learning circles between the panelists and graduate students.  The panelists include Dr. Anthony Kwame Harrison, Dr. Alicia Boatswain-Kyte, Dr. Bukola Salami, Dr. Giselle Thompson, Dr. Tanya Matthews, Dr. Tya Collins, and others.  Lunch and snacks will be served.  RSVP at forms.gle/YzNkfgpZ8MGaFoDV7.

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University.

                "description": "A new version by Anne Carson  “Euripides was a playwright of the fifth century BC who reinvented Greek tragedy, setting it on a path that leads straight to reality TV. His plays broke all the rules, upended convention and outraged conservative critics. The Bakkhai is his most subversive play, telling the story of a man who cannot admit he would rather live in the skin of a woman, and a god who seems to combine all sexualities into a single ruinous demand for adoration. Dionysos is the god of intoxication. Once you fall under his influence, there is no telling where you will end up.” - Anne Carson    Directed by David Jansen  Produced and Designed by York University Theatre Production and Design students    LOCATION  Joseph G.

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology. His work has been exhibited across North America, from the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Colorado University Art Museum, with his work in public collections at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, York University and the de Young Museum in San Francisco, among others. Of his many accolades and awards, he is the recent recipient of the 2022 Gershon Iskowitz prize at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the 2023 Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts for Artistic Achievement.    With over 15 years of experience in the field of contemporary art and photography, Liz Ikiriko has delivered large-scale, complex projects, working closely with a variety of artists, organizations and institutions. She builds long-lasting connections with organizations, including Wedge Curatorial Projects, the National Music Centre, Critical Distance Centre for Curators and the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival. Ikiriko received her master of fine arts in criticism and curatorial practice from OCAD University, and has taught photography at Toronto Metropolitan University and Sheridan College. She has written for and worked on publications including Maclean’s, Public Journal, MICE Magazine, Blackflash, Akimbo, C Magazine and, most recently, contributed to Aperture’s As We Rise: Photography From the Black Atlantic. She is co-founder of the Ways of Attuning Curatorial Study Group, a member of the curatorial committee for the 13th Rencontres de Bamako, African Photography Biennial in Mali. She is the inaugural curator of collections and art in public space at the University of Toronto’s Art Museum and was the previous curator of collections and contemporary art engagement at the AGYU.

                "description": "A new version by Anne Carson  “Euripides was a playwright of the fifth century BC who reinvented Greek tragedy, setting it on a path that leads straight to reality TV. His plays broke all the rules, upended convention and outraged conservative critics. The Bakkhai is his most subversive play, telling the story of a man who cannot admit he would rather live in the skin of a woman, and a god who seems to combine all sexualities into a single ruinous demand for adoration. Dionysos is the god of intoxication. Once you fall under his influence, there is no telling where you will end up.” - Anne Carson    Directed by David Jansen  Produced and Designed by York University Theatre Production and Design students    LOCATION  Joseph G.

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology. His work has been exhibited across North America, from the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Colorado University Art Museum, with his work in public collections at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, York University and the de Young Museum in San Francisco, among others. Of his many accolades and awards, he is the recent recipient of the 2022 Gershon Iskowitz prize at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the 2023 Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts for Artistic Achievement.    With over 15 years of experience in the field of contemporary art and photography, Liz Ikiriko has delivered large-scale, complex projects, working closely with a variety of artists, organizations and institutions. She builds long-lasting connections with organizations, including Wedge Curatorial Projects, the National Music Centre, Critical Distance Centre for Curators and the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival. Ikiriko received her master of fine arts in criticism and curatorial practice from OCAD University, and has taught photography at Toronto Metropolitan University and Sheridan College. She has written for and worked on publications including Maclean’s, Public Journal, MICE Magazine, Blackflash, Akimbo, C Magazine and, most recently, contributed to Aperture’s As We Rise: Photography From the Black Atlantic. She is co-founder of the Ways of Attuning Curatorial Study Group, a member of the curatorial committee for the 13th Rencontres de Bamako, African Photography Biennial in Mali. She is the inaugural curator of collections and art in public space at the University of Toronto’s Art Museum and was the previous curator of collections and contemporary art engagement at the AGYU.

                "description": "Dance Innovations 2023: Infinite Corners features the new choreographic works of 25 fourth year BFA majors performed by students engaged in all levels of York’s programs in Dance. As we find ourselves in a time of recuperation following the pandemic, these creators are asking: what does it mean to move forward now? How are we coming alive in our collaborative work differently? If infinite corners lead to circles and cycles, the goal of this production is to enliven the ideas, processes, and narratives that are important to this group of emerging artists. The two series of Infinite Corners feature world premieres by fourth year choreographers and by Professor Susan Lee for the Department’s third year Performance class. Students are guided by faculty at every level of creation, performance, lighting design and production and it is the students who collaborate to run Dance Innovations, staged in the McLean Performance Studio, November 22, 23 and 24 at 7pm and 8:30pm.    Artistic Director and 4th year Choreography Course Director: Tracey Norman  Course Director 3rd year Performance: Susan Lee  Production Manager, Lighting Designer and Course Director: Jennifer Jimenez  Stage Manager: Sophia Fabiano    Dance Innovations: Infinite Corners   Series A: Continuous - Wed, Nov 22 to Fri, Nov 24 at 7 pm   Features a world premiere by Professor Susan Lee in collaboration with the 3rd year Performance class and Professor Don Sinclair (Computational Arts), and new choreographic works by fourth year students with student lighting design and production support.

                "description": "A new version by Anne Carson  “Euripides was a playwright of the fifth century BC who reinvented Greek tragedy, setting it on a path that leads straight to reality TV. His plays broke all the rules, upended convention and outraged conservative critics. The Bakkhai is his most subversive play, telling the story of a man who cannot admit he would rather live in the skin of a woman, and a god who seems to combine all sexualities into a single ruinous demand for adoration. Dionysos is the god of intoxication. Once you fall under his influence, there is no telling where you will end up.” - Anne Carson    Directed by David Jansen  Produced and Designed by York University Theatre Production and Design students    LOCATION  Joseph G.

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology. His work has been exhibited across North America, from the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Colorado University Art Museum, with his work in public collections at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, York University and the de Young Museum in San Francisco, among others. Of his many accolades and awards, he is the recent recipient of the 2022 Gershon Iskowitz prize at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the 2023 Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts for Artistic Achievement.    With over 15 years of experience in the field of contemporary art and photography, Liz Ikiriko has delivered large-scale, complex projects, working closely with a variety of artists, organizations and institutions. She builds long-lasting connections with organizations, including Wedge Curatorial Projects, the National Music Centre, Critical Distance Centre for Curators and the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival. Ikiriko received her master of fine arts in criticism and curatorial practice from OCAD University, and has taught photography at Toronto Metropolitan University and Sheridan College. She has written for and worked on publications including Maclean’s, Public Journal, MICE Magazine, Blackflash, Akimbo, C Magazine and, most recently, contributed to Aperture’s As We Rise: Photography From the Black Atlantic. She is co-founder of the Ways of Attuning Curatorial Study Group, a member of the curatorial committee for the 13th Rencontres de Bamako, African Photography Biennial in Mali. She is the inaugural curator of collections and art in public space at the University of Toronto’s Art Museum and was the previous curator of collections and contemporary art engagement at the AGYU.

                "description": "Dance Innovations 2023: Infinite Corners features the new choreographic works of 25 fourth year BFA majors performed by students engaged in all levels of York’s programs in Dance. As we find ourselves in a time of recuperation following the pandemic, these creators are asking: what does it mean to move forward now? How are we coming alive in our collaborative work differently? If infinite corners lead to circles and cycles, the goal of this production is to enliven the ideas, processes, and narratives that are important to this group of emerging artists. The two series of Infinite Corners feature world premieres by fourth year choreographers and by Professor Susan Lee for the Department’s third year Performance class. Students are guided by faculty at every level of creation, performance, lighting design and production and it is the students who collaborate to run Dance Innovations, staged in the McLean Performance Studio, November 22, 23 and 24 at 7pm and 8:30pm.

                "description": "A new version by Anne Carson  “Euripides was a playwright of the fifth century BC who reinvented Greek tragedy, setting it on a path that leads straight to reality TV. His plays broke all the rules, upended convention and outraged conservative critics. The Bakkhai is his most subversive play, telling the story of a man who cannot admit he would rather live in the skin of a woman, and a god who seems to combine all sexualities into a single ruinous demand for adoration. Dionysos is the god of intoxication. Once you fall under his influence, there is no telling where you will end up.” - Anne Carson    Directed by David Jansen  Produced and Designed by York University Theatre Production and Design students    LOCATION  Joseph G.

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology. His work has been exhibited across North America, from the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Colorado University Art Museum, with his work in public collections at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, York University and the de Young Museum in San Francisco, among others. Of his many accolades and awards, he is the recent recipient of the 2022 Gershon Iskowitz prize at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the 2023 Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts for Artistic Achievement.    With over 15 years of experience in the field of contemporary art and photography, Liz Ikiriko has delivered large-scale, complex projects, working closely with a variety of artists, organizations and institutions. She builds long-lasting connections with organizations, including Wedge Curatorial Projects, the National Music Centre, Critical Distance Centre for Curators and the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival. Ikiriko received her master of fine arts in criticism and curatorial practice from OCAD University, and has taught photography at Toronto Metropolitan University and Sheridan College. She has written for and worked on publications including Maclean’s, Public Journal, MICE Magazine, Blackflash, Akimbo, C Magazine and, most recently, contributed to Aperture’s As We Rise: Photography From the Black Atlantic. She is co-founder of the Ways of Attuning Curatorial Study Group, a member of the curatorial committee for the 13th Rencontres de Bamako, African Photography Biennial in Mali. She is the inaugural curator of collections and art in public space at the University of Toronto’s Art Museum and was the previous curator of collections and contemporary art engagement at the AGYU.

                "description": "Dance Innovations 2023: Infinite Corners features the new choreographic works of 25 fourth year BFA majors performed by students engaged in all levels of York’s programs in Dance. As we find ourselves in a time of recuperation following the pandemic, these creators are asking: what does it mean to move forward now? How are we coming alive in our collaborative work differently? If infinite corners lead to circles and cycles, the goal of this production is to enliven the ideas, processes, and narratives that are important to this group of emerging artists. The two series of Infinite Corners feature world premieres by fourth year choreographers and by Professor Susan Lee for the Department’s third year Performance class. Students are guided by faculty at every level of creation, performance, lighting design and production and it is the students who collaborate to run Dance Innovations, staged in the McLean Performance Studio, November 22, 23 and 24 at 7pm and 8:30pm.

                "description": "A new version by Anne Carson  “Euripides was a playwright of the fifth century BC who reinvented Greek tragedy, setting it on a path that leads straight to reality TV. His plays broke all the rules, upended convention and outraged conservative critics. The Bakkhai is his most subversive play, telling the story of a man who cannot admit he would rather live in the skin of a woman, and a god who seems to combine all sexualities into a single ruinous demand for adoration. Dionysos is the god of intoxication. Once you fall under his influence, there is no telling where you will end up.” - Anne Carson    Directed by David Jansen  Produced and Designed by York University Theatre Production and Design students    LOCATION  Joseph G.

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology. His work has been exhibited across North America, from the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Colorado University Art Museum, with his work in public collections at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, York University and the de Young Museum in San Francisco, among others. Of his many accolades and awards, he is the recent recipient of the 2022 Gershon Iskowitz prize at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the 2023 Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts for Artistic Achievement.    With over 15 years of experience in the field of contemporary art and photography, Liz Ikiriko has delivered large-scale, complex projects, working closely with a variety of artists, organizations and institutions. She builds long-lasting connections with organizations, including Wedge Curatorial Projects, the National Music Centre, Critical Distance Centre for Curators and the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival. Ikiriko received her master of fine arts in criticism and curatorial practice from OCAD University, and has taught photography at Toronto Metropolitan University and Sheridan College. She has written for and worked on publications including Maclean’s, Public Journal, MICE Magazine, Blackflash, Akimbo, C Magazine and, most recently, contributed to Aperture’s As We Rise: Photography From the Black Atlantic. She is co-founder of the Ways of Attuning Curatorial Study Group, a member of the curatorial committee for the 13th Rencontres de Bamako, African Photography Biennial in Mali. She is the inaugural curator of collections and art in public space at the University of Toronto’s Art Museum and was the previous curator of collections and contemporary art engagement at the AGYU.

                "description": "A new version by Anne Carson  “Euripides was a playwright of the fifth century BC who reinvented Greek tragedy, setting it on a path that leads straight to reality TV. His plays broke all the rules, upended convention and outraged conservative critics. The Bakkhai is his most subversive play, telling the story of a man who cannot admit he would rather live in the skin of a woman, and a god who seems to combine all sexualities into a single ruinous demand for adoration. Dionysos is the god of intoxication. Once you fall under his influence, there is no telling where you will end up.” - Anne Carson    Directed by David Jansen  Produced and Designed by York University Theatre Production and Design students    LOCATION  Joseph G.

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology. His work has been exhibited across North America, from the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Colorado University Art Museum, with his work in public collections at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, York University and the de Young Museum in San Francisco, among others. Of his many accolades and awards, he is the recent recipient of the 2022 Gershon Iskowitz prize at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the 2023 Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts for Artistic Achievement.    With over 15 years of experience in the field of contemporary art and photography, Liz Ikiriko has delivered large-scale, complex projects, working closely with a variety of artists, organizations and institutions. She builds long-lasting connections with organizations, including Wedge Curatorial Projects, the National Music Centre, Critical Distance Centre for Curators and the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival. Ikiriko received her master of fine arts in criticism and curatorial practice from OCAD University, and has taught photography at Toronto Metropolitan University and Sheridan College. She has written for and worked on publications including Maclean’s, Public Journal, MICE Magazine, Blackflash, Akimbo, C Magazine and, most recently, contributed to Aperture’s As We Rise: Photography From the Black Atlantic. She is co-founder of the Ways of Attuning Curatorial Study Group, a member of the curatorial committee for the 13th Rencontres de Bamako, African Photography Biennial in Mali. She is the inaugural curator of collections and art in public space at the University of Toronto’s Art Museum and was the previous curator of collections and contemporary art engagement at the AGYU.

                "description": "If the colder weather and shorter days are making you feel down and fatigued, you are not alone. It is very normal for many individuals to experience feelings of sadness or a deflated mood during this time of year. These feelings may be also worsened by the uncertainty, stress, grief and burnout due to the pandemic. Did you know that 15 % of Canadians experience mild symptoms of seasonal affective disorder (SAD)?  This may include deflated mood, feeling demotivated, changes in sleep, appetite, or extreme fatigue. Even without a formal diagnosis you may still be feeling the effects of the winter blues. In this workshop, we go over some coping strategies we can implement to help counteract these overwhelming feelings and improve our well-being while living through these uncertain times!

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology. His work has been exhibited across North America, from the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Colorado University Art Museum, with his work in public collections at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, York University and the de Young Museum in San Francisco, among others. Of his many accolades and awards, he is the recent recipient of the 2022 Gershon Iskowitz prize at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the 2023 Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts for Artistic Achievement.    With over 15 years of experience in the field of contemporary art and photography, Liz Ikiriko has delivered large-scale, complex projects, working closely with a variety of artists, organizations and institutions. She builds long-lasting connections with organizations, including Wedge Curatorial Projects, the National Music Centre, Critical Distance Centre for Curators and the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival. Ikiriko received her master of fine arts in criticism and curatorial practice from OCAD University, and has taught photography at Toronto Metropolitan University and Sheridan College. She has written for and worked on publications including Maclean’s, Public Journal, MICE Magazine, Blackflash, Akimbo, C Magazine and, most recently, contributed to Aperture’s As We Rise: Photography From the Black Atlantic. She is co-founder of the Ways of Attuning Curatorial Study Group, a member of the curatorial committee for the 13th Rencontres de Bamako, African Photography Biennial in Mali. She is the inaugural curator of collections and art in public space at the University of Toronto’s Art Museum and was the previous curator of collections and contemporary art engagement at the AGYU.

                "description": "This session is held in collaboration with Health Education &amp; Promotion.      Let’s face it, today’s culture values perfection.  We may feel pressure towards academic excellence, especially as mature/part-time students where the stakes on achieving academic success are especially high.  As a result, some of us might experience perfectionist tendencies from time to time. These experiences may include fear of failure, disapproval or disappointment of oneself. Despite best efforts, it might make it difficult to cultivate one’s own self-compassion.  Do you need new strategies to increase your resilience and overcome burnout? This workshop will look at the function of stress, how it affects our well-being, and how we can develop realistic strategies to build and implement resilience as mature/part-time students. We will also look at practices for self-compassion and mindfulness tools that support stress-reduction. Registration is required.     *NOTE: This session is open to all Mature, Transfer, Part-time and Ready Set YU students.     Register in advance for this meeting: https://yorku.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJEsdeuvrD0sGN3Tc8GO3Y_RJZRhGAh4H4H_     After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting.

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology. His work has been exhibited across North America, from the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Colorado University Art Museum, with his work in public collections at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, York University and the de Young Museum in San Francisco, among others. Of his many accolades and awards, he is the recent recipient of the 2022 Gershon Iskowitz prize at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the 2023 Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts for Artistic Achievement.    With over 15 years of experience in the field of contemporary art and photography, Liz Ikiriko has delivered large-scale, complex projects, working closely with a variety of artists, organizations and institutions. She builds long-lasting connections with organizations, including Wedge Curatorial Projects, the National Music Centre, Critical Distance Centre for Curators and the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival. Ikiriko received her master of fine arts in criticism and curatorial practice from OCAD University, and has taught photography at Toronto Metropolitan University and Sheridan College. She has written for and worked on publications including Maclean’s, Public Journal, MICE Magazine, Blackflash, Akimbo, C Magazine and, most recently, contributed to Aperture’s As We Rise: Photography From the Black Atlantic. She is co-founder of the Ways of Attuning Curatorial Study Group, a member of the curatorial committee for the 13th Rencontres de Bamako, African Photography Biennial in Mali. She is the inaugural curator of collections and art in public space at the University of Toronto’s Art Museum and was the previous curator of collections and contemporary art engagement at the AGYU.

                "description": "When a person is striving to achieve perfection, they end up having a high standard to the point where even the thought of getting started brings up feelings of fear and anxiety.      A person who struggles with a dilemma uses procrastination as a protective mechanism to avoid the possibility of failing because they’ve internalized a perfect view of themselves and want to protect themselves from not achieving that view. Even though this type of person has a high need to succeed, they also have a high fear of failure making it more likely to procrastinate on a task.     If you can relate to this too, join the Health Education &amp; Promotion team as we:       Look at what Perfectionism and Procrastination are, their underlying factors and how the two relate to one another.     Explore ways to combat both perfectionism and procrastination, the discussion will include all or nothing thinking, receiving criticism and the practice of self-kindness.

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology. His work has been exhibited across North America, from the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Colorado University Art Museum, with his work in public collections at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, York University and the de Young Museum in San Francisco, among others. Of his many accolades and awards, he is the recent recipient of the 2022 Gershon Iskowitz prize at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the 2023 Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts for Artistic Achievement.    With over 15 years of experience in the field of contemporary art and photography, Liz Ikiriko has delivered large-scale, complex projects, working closely with a variety of artists, organizations and institutions. She builds long-lasting connections with organizations, including Wedge Curatorial Projects, the National Music Centre, Critical Distance Centre for Curators and the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival. Ikiriko received her master of fine arts in criticism and curatorial practice from OCAD University, and has taught photography at Toronto Metropolitan University and Sheridan College. She has written for and worked on publications including Maclean’s, Public Journal, MICE Magazine, Blackflash, Akimbo, C Magazine and, most recently, contributed to Aperture’s As We Rise: Photography From the Black Atlantic. She is co-founder of the Ways of Attuning Curatorial Study Group, a member of the curatorial committee for the 13th Rencontres de Bamako, African Photography Biennial in Mali. She is the inaugural curator of collections and art in public space at the University of Toronto’s Art Museum and was the previous curator of collections and contemporary art engagement at the AGYU.

                "description": "The Art Gallery of York University (AGYU) presents:    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire    Sept. 15 to Dec. 03    Guest curated by Liz Ikiriko    Opening reception: Thursday, Sept. 14, 6 to 9 p.m.    The AGYU is honoured to announce our upcoming fall exhibition, Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire. Please save the date, Thursday, Sept. 14, from 6 to 9 p.m. for the public reception with the artist and guest curator in attendance.    Tim Whiten: Elemental Fire brings together over 14 cultural objects from the past four decades of Tim Whiten’s prolific career, including works in glass, on paper and a new site-specific installation created specifically for this exhibition. Whiten’s enduring 50-plus-year practice has been clearly and consistently focused on the known and unknowable, on practical and ephemeral aspects that fundamentally propel and challenge human existence and consciousness.    Elemental Fire, guest curated by Liz Ikiriko, considers how the material transformations of fire appear in Whiten’s work as forms of alchemy, risk, play and energetic power. Often alluding to notions of time and faith through histories of storytelling and spirituality (ranging from prehistoric, Greek and Roman mythology through to Kabbalist and Buddhist traditions), Whiten’s work returns us to consider primary questions of our bodies, our presence and our value in this current moment.    Elemental Fire is part of an expanded, multi-venue retrospective and collaborative publication celebrating Whiten’s extensive career, developed as a partnership with the Art Gallery of Peterborough, the Art Gallery of York University, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery and the McMaster Museum of Art from 2022 to 2023. This series of exhibitions shares the nomenclature “elemental” and is thematically united by the classical elements of air, water, earth and fire – a reference to Whiten’s interest in alchemical practices. The AGYU is pleased to present the final exhibition of this series.    As part of Elemental Fire, the AGYU will present an active program of conversations, readings and performances, including: a curatorial walk-through by Liz Ikiriko (Sept. 16); a panel discussion with the curators of the Elemental series of exhibitions (Oct. 18); an offsite respondent talk by scholar Nehal El-Hadi and an experimental sound response by artist Zoma Tochi Maduekwe (Nov. 14); and an online reading group led by artist and writer Farhia Tato (Oct. 24 and Nov. 28).    Tim Whiten was born in Inkster, Michigan, in 1941. Self-described as an image maker and creator of cultural objects, Whiten’s practice spans five decades. He received a master off fine arts from the University of Oregon in 1966 and served military duty from 1966 to 1968. Immigrating to Toronto later that year, he began his teaching career in the Division of Humanities in the Faculty of Arts at York University. For 39 years, Whiten inspired thousands of students in their creative pursuits; as an award-winning educator and Chair of York University’s Department of Visual Arts, he has contributed to generations of the Toronto arts ecology. His work has been exhibited across North America, from the Museum of Contemporary Art Toronto to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Colorado University Art Museum, with his work in public collections at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Art Gallery of Hamilton, York University and the de Young Museum in San Francisco, among others. Of his many accolades and awards, he is the recent recipient of the 2022 Gershon Iskowitz prize at the Art Gallery of Ontario and the 2023 Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts for Artistic Achievement.    With over 15 years of experience in the field of contemporary art and photography, Liz Ikiriko has delivered large-scale, complex projects, working closely with a variety of artists, organizations and institutions. She builds long-lasting connections with organizations, including Wedge Curatorial Projects, the National Music Centre, Critical Distance Centre for Curators and the Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival. Ikiriko received her master of fine arts in criticism and curatorial practice from OCAD University, and has taught photography at Toronto Metropolitan University and Sheridan College. She has written for and worked on publications including Maclean’s, Public Journal, MICE Magazine, Blackflash, Akimbo, C Magazine and, most recently, contributed to Aperture’s As We Rise: Photography From the Black Atlantic. She is co-founder of the Ways of Attuning Curatorial Study Group, a member of the curatorial committee for the 13th Rencontres de Bamako, African Photography Biennial in Mali. She is the inaugural curator of collections and art in public space at the University of Toronto’s Art Museum and was the previous curator of collections and contemporary art engagement at the AGYU.
