<p>A dedicated educator, a tireless social activist and a passionate politician; few members of the York University community have had as extraordinary and lasting impact on society as the Honourable Jean Augustine, Canada’s first Black woman to be elected to the House of Commons and the first to be appointed to federal cabinet.</p>



<p>Last week, community members joined Augustine at York’s Keele Campus to celebrate an announcement of funding from the federal government to support the <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/edu/jean-augustine-chair/">endowed university Chair</a> in her name.</p>



<p>The Hon. Kamal Khera, Canada’s Minister of Diversity, Inclusion, and Persons with Disabilities delivered the news, “Having access to equal opportunities and a brighter future should not depend on the color of your skin or your origins. Our government is committed to dismantling systemic barriers wherever they persist in our country,” she said. “Partnering with organizations like the Jean Augustine Chair in Education, Community, and Diaspora, we are creating pathways to education for Black youth and future Black scholars, thereby building a stronger, more prosperous Canada.”</p>



<p>The $1.5 million federal contribution represents a major milestone for the endowed Chair – now fully funded with more than $3 million, thanks in large part to many years of dedicated grassroots fundraising efforts led by Augustine, supported by her devoted network, and backed by matching funds provided by the University.</p>



<p>President Rhonda Lenton delivered heartfelt remarks on behalf of York, reflecting on the importance of the work the Chair will support, including scholarly research, programs, partnerships and new opportunities for Black communities in Toronto and beyond.</p>



<p>“We are grateful for the generous support of the Government of Canada which will build on Jean Augustine’s legacy and vision and enable the Chair to continue in perpetuity — fostering the success of current and future Black scholars and students, and addressing systemic barriers to advance access, equity and inclusivity in education,” Lenton said.</p>

<p>Augustine paid tribute to those who have supported her vision over the years, “Since 2008, we have been diligently raising funds to secure this vital community resource. The generous donation we received has allowed us to reach our goal, and our community is deeply grateful for this invaluable contribution,” she said.</p>



<p>The announcement follows a history of determined fundraising since the Chair was established. Efforts led by Jean Augustine herself, and community-inspired efforts like the <a href="https://yfile.news.yorku.ca/2021/02/28/donations-surpass-goal-to-raise-25k-in-25-days-for-jean-augustine-chair/">“25K in 25 Days” campaign</a> in 2021 ensured success in raising $1.08 million towards the endowment, which was then matched with a further $1.08 million by the University.</p>



<p>Prof. Carl James, who currently holds the Chair, and Faculty of Education Dean Robert Savage also spoke to those gathered, including Member of Parliament Arielle Kayabaga, and former Dean of the Faculty of Education Paul Axelrod, among many esteemed community members, partners and advocates.</p>



<p>James is the current Chair and a recently appointed distinguished research professor in the Faculty of Education. His work builds on Augustine’s vision. A renowned researcher and prolific writer, James is widely recognized for his research contributions and for leading efforts to enhance educational and social outcomes for Black youth across Canada. His groundbreaking research on streaming – the exercise of choosing between ‘applied’ or ‘academic’ courses, found to disproportionately affect Black students – ultimately led to the provincial government ending the practice in Ontario high schools.</p>



<p>The real-life impact of this work was evident at a free documentary film screening later in the day at the Price Family Cinema on York’s Keele Campus, where students from James Cardinal McGuigan Catholic High School and Monsignor Percy Johnson Catholic School cheered in a standing ovation after receiving news that the Chair had been fully funded.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.yorku.ca/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/242/2023/11/P1130965-1024x768.jpg" alt="The Honourable Jean Augustine and author Itah Sadu in conversation following a screening of Steadfast - The Messenger and the Message." class="wp-image-18728" srcset="https://www.yorku.ca/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/242/2023/11/P1130965-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.yorku.ca/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/242/2023/11/P1130965-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.yorku.ca/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/242/2023/11/P1130965-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.yorku.ca/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/242/2023/11/P1130965-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>The Honourable Jean Augustine and author Itah Sadu in conversation following a screening of Steadfast - The Messenger and the Message.</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The documentary <em>Steadfast – The Messenger and the Message,</em> follows Augustine’s journey “from Happy Hill to Parliament Hill,” and traces her beginnings as a teacher in Grenada and deep connection to her Caribbean roots. The film highlighted how her early experience informed her work and social activism in Canada – from establishing Black History Month in Canada in 1995, to the community-engaged work the Jean Augustine Chair advances today.</p>



<p>Initiatives like the <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/edu/jean-augustine-chair/projects/day-at-york/">Day at York</a> program (providing Black students enrolled in grades 7-12 an opportunity to explore their post-secondary education options) or the <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/edu/jean-augustine-chair/projects/black-internship-program-co-op-credit/">Black Internship Program (Co-op) Credit</a> (designed to increase Black leadership and education engagement through skills development and experiential learning) are only two examples of how Augustine’s legacy has shaped the University and neighbouring communities in positive ways.</p>



<p>In a post-screening conversation with bestselling author and fellow <a href="https://yfile.news.yorku.ca/2023/10/13/itah-sadu-spurs-graduands-to-shine-bright/">York honorary degree recipient, Itah Sadu</a>, Augustine reflected on both her age and her impressive list of accolades and accomplishments: “You can’t put 86 years into 57 minutes, but we tried.” More than 60 years since arriving in Canada, Augustine’s impressive legacy continues to grow – outpaced only by her passion for public service, community, and the power of education.</p>

<p><em>First-ever global survey done in partnership with professor from York Faculty of Education Deaf and Hard of Hearing Education program</em></p>



<p><strong>TORONTO, Nov. 9, 2023 — </strong><a href="https://ciicanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/CI-SERVICES-MATTER-REPORT-FINAL-2.pdf">A global survey</a> put out by York University’s Faculty of Education and the Cochlear Implant International Community of Action (CIICA), a user advocacy organization, shows that most deaf and deafened adults who have cochlear implants are satisfied with them, but significantly more follow-up and lifelong supports are needed.</p>



<p>“If we are to make the most of this amazing development in global hearing health, we need also to ensure that the one million cochlear implant (CI) users around the world are fully supported in the long term — and it is not only those with deep pockets who can afford to have this life enhancing support,” says <a href="https://edu.yorku.ca/edu-profiles/index.php?mid=6222">Professor Connie Mayer</a>, who has been working in deaf education for nearly 40 years and is the academic coordinator for the <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/edu/students/deaf-and-hard-of-hearing/">Deaf and Hard of Hearing Teacher Education Program</a> at York University.</p>



<p>Cochlear implantation requires surgery to implant a receiver in the inner ear, and the fitting of an external processor to enable the user to hear. Profoundly deaf users found that the implants transformed their abilities to hear and communicate in everyday life. As one user commented, “<em>Going back to listening is priceless – my life has been completely changed for the better.” &nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The resulting report, which <a href="file:///C:/Users/sandramc/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/KL9CIHLV/CIICA%20LIVE/%20CI%20SERVICES%20MATTER%20–%20CIICA">will be presented at an online webinar Nov. 20</a> by Mayer and collaborators from CIICA, indicates that 96 per cent of CI users expressed overall satisfaction with their implants and although the same number says they were satisfied with the services they received, the survey also revealed where services were lacking.<em></em></p>



<p>&nbsp;The report found that users often struggled to get appropriate support and rehabilitation after surgery as they learned to use their implant, with more than a quarter receiving no rehabilitation support and nearly a third feeling they did not have enough support. Users are reliant on their CI for everyday communication and required lifelong technical support for the external parts of the device: “<em>I need services so that my CI will work and be supported right up to the day I die.”</em></p>



<p>Significant numbers reported issues with follow-up support, mostly related to lack of funding. “Users need support for rehab and ongoing management of the technology including processor upgrades and spare parts such as cables and cords. So if there’s no funding for that follow-up, that’s a big problem,” says Mayer.</p>



<p>The report’s authors call for significant changes in the way CI services are provided by health systems to ensure that these deaf and hard of hearing adults can retain their independence and that health and social care systems save on the increased burdens that would otherwise result.</p>



<p>“This survey gives us a picture of the life-changing impact of this technology from the perspective of the users themselves – a message that needs to heard.”</p>



<p>The Deaf and Hard of Hearing Teacher Education Program at York University has been around for 30 years and is the only one of its kind in Ontario and one of only a few in Canada. It provides training and accreditation to qualified teachers who are looking to work with deaf and hard of hearing students.</p>

<p>In exactly one year this week — on Nov. 5, 2024 — Americans will vote for their next president. Joe Biden and Donald Trump are likely to face each other again.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft is-resized"><a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/557602/original/file-20231105-15-scs8bf.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip"><img loading="lazy" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/557602/original/file-20231105-15-scs8bf.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip" alt="An older man in sunglasses waves." width="315" height="210"/></a><figcaption>President Joe Biden waves as he walks to board Air Force One at Dover Air Force Base, Del., in June 2023.&nbsp;(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Both candidates have flaws but so far have batted away&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/americans-offer-unflattering-opinions-on-both-biden-and-trump-in-latest-ap-norc-poll">all contenders from within</a>&nbsp;their own parties.</p>



<p>Biden, who turns 81 in a few days, has the majority of both Democrats and Republicans believing&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-age-poll-trump-2024-620e0a5cfa0039a6448f607c17c7f23e">he’s too old</a>&nbsp;for a second term.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-63654388">no serious Democratic challenger has emerged</a>. Unless Biden withdraws, he can be assured of the Democratic nomination, notwithstanding the unenthusiastic support from many in his party. Kamala Harris will return as his running mate.</p>



<p>Trump, 77, has kept Republican rivals at bay. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was thought to be a serious threat to Trump but has faltered badly.</p>



<p>The most recent polls of Iowa Republican caucus-goers show DeSantis&nbsp;<a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/caucus/2023/10/30/iowa-poll-donald-trump-leads-ron-desantis-nikki-haley-tied-presidential-candidates-gop-caucus/71342485007/">now tied for a distant second place</a>&nbsp;with Nikki Haley, former governor of South Carolina.</p>



<h2>Four indictments? No problem</h2>



<p>Trump towers over DeSantis and Haley in every poll. His <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/24/politics/gop-debate-trump-surrender-analysis/index.html">legal troubles have not dented his support</a> among Republican voters.</p>



<p>If Trump is the Republican nominee, former vice-president Mike Pence won’t return as his running mate. Pence <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/former-us-vp-pence-says-he-is-suspending-his-presidential-campaign-2023-10-28/">has ended his own uninspiring run</a> for the presidency.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mike Pence electrifying a huge crowd of diverse supporters. <a href="https://t.co/85GQQdDCDu">pic.twitter.com/85GQQdDCDu</a></p>&mdash; No Lie with Brian Tyler Cohen (@NoLieWithBTC) <a href="https://twitter.com/NoLieWithBTC/status/1715848577363140645?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>There has been no love lost between the two men since the turbulent end of Trump’s presidency. Trump will have the opportunity to select someone new, making the Republican ticket in 2024 different from that in 2016 and 2020.</p>



<p>Although vice-presidential nominees typically do not swing elections, John McCain’s disastrous decision to select Alaska’s governor, Sarah Palin, as his vice-presidential candidate in the 2008 presidential campaign serves a warning that a poor choice does harm a campaign.</p>

<p>In a Trump-Biden rematch, vice-presidential nominees may matter more than usual. The advanced age of Biden — who would be 82 at the start of his second term, while Trump would be 78 — means that there is higher than normal likelihood of the vice-president assuming the presidential office.</p>

<h2>What to watch for</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/557603/original/file-20231105-21-8srzl7.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip" alt="A black-and-white photo of a round-faced man with a moustache." width="155" height="199"/><figcaption>President Grover Cleveland poses for a photo in 1892.&nbsp;(AP Photo)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Rematches in presidential elections are rare. The most recent was in the 1950s, when Dwight D. Eisenhower faced Adlai Stevenson in two consecutive elections.</p>



<p>Democrat Grover Cleveland stands alone in American history as the only president to serve non-consecutive terms — the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thegazette.com/guest-columnists/weve-had-two-clevelands-so-how-about-two-trumps/">exclusive club that Trump hopes to join</a>. Just like Trump, Cleveland served one term and was defeated by Benjamin Harrison, but returned to power by soundly defeating Harrison four years later.</p>



<p>Biden’s campaign will undoubtedly be carefully stage-managed to limit his travels and public engagements. He will likely rely on others — Harris and other Democratic party politicians — for the hard slogging. His campaign will have a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/biden-hopes-get-re-elected-little-help-friends-rcna85898">“Team Biden” approach</a> in an effort to convince voters he has a capable — and younger — team behind him.</p>



<p>Trump, on the other hand, will aim to keep up hectic travel to swing states if only to differentiate himself from Biden. Not unsurprisingly, Trump’s campaign will be less about the Republican party and his team and far more about him.</p>



<p>Biden’s unprecedented&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-makes-history-striking-auto-workers-picket-line-rcna117348">attendance at United Auto Workers’ strike rally</a>&nbsp;in Michigan in September points to upcoming battlegrounds that will help decide the 2024 election.</p>



<p>Given the nature of American elections, some states routinely vote Republican, and others Democrat. New York, for example, has been a Democratic state for the past nine presidential elections.</p>



<p>However, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia swing back and forth. These are the&nbsp;<a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/3870203-these-6-states-will-determine-the-2024-presidential-election/">states that must be won for a candidate to be elected president</a>. Trump won all six in 2016 but lost in five in 2020.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/557601/original/file-20231105-29-q26lxi.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" alt="An older man in a ball cap speaks into a megaphone on a picket line." width="346" height="231"/><figcaption>President Joe Biden joins striking United Auto Workers on the picket line in September 2023 in Van Buren Township, Mich.&nbsp;(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>Looking back at Nixon vs. Kennedy</h2>



<p>Presidential elections are influenced, and in some cases even decided, by the personal appearances and day-to-day activities of the candidate. For both Trump and Biden, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/kennedy-nixon-debates">1960 presidential debate is instructive</a>.</p>



<p>Richard Nixon came to the debate with a lack of makeup, a five o’clock shadow, grey suit and directed his comments at the studio audience rather than the TV camera.</p>



<p>In contrast, John F. Kennedy was tanned, blue suited and spoke directly to the camera. Those who watched the debate on television declared Kennedy the winner, while those who listened on the radio concluded that Nixon’s performance was superior.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright"><img src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/557604/original/file-20231105-23-c2kn7n.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=237&amp;fit=clip" alt="Two men stand at podiums in a black-and-white photo."/><figcaption>In this 1960 file photo, John F. Kennedy speaks as Vice President Richard M. Nixon listens during the fourth presidential debate from a New York studio. The 1960 presidential election offered the country’s first televised debates.&nbsp;(AP Photo)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>For Biden in particular, but also Trump, a stumble while climbing stairs, a momentary loss of memory or citing incorrect facts during a speech will be mercilessly exploited by the opponent.</p>



<p>In an environment were cameras are everywhere and social media is the major tool used to reach voters, both Biden’s and Trump’s campaigns will be tightly scripted and rely as much as possible on pre-recorded video.</p>



<p>Whatever else the 2024 election campaign will hold, a Biden-Trump rematch offers American voters two contenders they know intimately. Like all sequels, that’s both good and bad news.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="bsf_rt_marker">
<p>In late September, Elon Musk, the tech billionaire behind Tesla and SpaceX, set the internet ablaze with his visit to the Texas-Mexico border to provide what he called an “<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/why-did-elon-musk-visit-texas-mexico-border-and-what-did-he-say-about-the-migrants/articleshow/104034433.cms?from=mdr">unfiltered</a>” perspective on the border crisis as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/migrants-cross-into-texas-undeterred-by-razor-wire-or-new-asylum-rules-2023-09-28/">thousands of migrants</a>, mostly from Venezuela, crossed the Rio Grande River.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1707565081750290910?s=20">In a video at Eagle Pass, Texas</a>, Musk calls for a “greatly expanded legal immigration system” that would welcome “hard-working and honest” people and “<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1707525800830828619?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1707525800830828619%7Ctwgr%5E3df67ff84fb408e2c51eceefcad89b5db37b30d0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailysignal.com%2F2023%2F09%2F29%2Felon-musk-visits-eagle-pass-livestreams-real-story-of-whats-happening-at-southern-border%2F">not let anyone in the country who is breaking the law</a>.”</p>



<p>Many were quick to highlight the absurdity of the world’s richest person, who is himself an immigrant, standing before a group of other immigrants calling for stricter policies.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed alignleft is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh look it&#39;s the richest guy in the world cosplaying as a cowboy in front of desperately poor people for clout <a href="https://t.co/H72ARHc9k5">https://t.co/H72ARHc9k5</a></p>&mdash; eve6 (@Eve6) <a href="https://twitter.com/Eve6/status/1708283629665927576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<h2>Pro-immigrant but anti-asylum?</h2>



<p>Musk’s position on immigration appears convoluted. On the one hand, he says he is “<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1707525800830828619?s=20">extremely pro-immigrant</a>,” given he is an immigrant to the United States himself. This also makes sense from the perspective of his businesses, which rely on <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7z5px/twitter-employees-on-visas-cant-just-quit">highly skilled migrant workers</a>.</p>



<p>While Musk said he supports legal immigration, he said the U.S. should “not be allowing people in the country if they are breaking the law.” A day before his visit to the border, Musk&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1707146779894951982?s=20">tweeted</a>&nbsp;support for a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-trump-wall-us-mexico-border-2023-9">Trump-style wall</a>&nbsp;to securitize the border. He implied that asylum seekers were entering without evidence to support their claims and they could “literally Google to know exactly what to say” to border officers.</p>



<p>Musk’s peddling of right wing anti-refugee rhetoric isn’t surprising, but the misinformation shared in Musk’s self-proclaimed “unfiltered” video may inadvertently bolster border militarization, increased repatriations and the criminalization of vulnerable asylum seekers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed alignright is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Went to the Eagle Pass border crossing to see what’s really going on <a href="https://t.co/ADYY2XvAKT">pic.twitter.com/ADYY2XvAKT</a></p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1707565081750290910?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>For example, during Musk’s border visit, congressman Tony Gonzales shares an anecdote about an asylum seeker he saw that had teardrop tattoos on their face. Musk calls this person a “serial murderer and proud of it” and made the leap that America has become the place people “go to escape the law.”</p>



<p>This kind of language plays into tropes that paint immigrants as dangerous and criminal. However, research has demonstrated that immigrants are not more likely to commit crimes.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/u-s-citizens-most-likely-to-commit-crimes-than-immigrants/">Research from 2022</a>&nbsp;found U.S. citizens are more than two times more likely to be arrested for a violent crime than undocumented immigrants.</p>



<p>In the video, Gonzales claimed there has been zero repatriation. However,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-border-doesnt-need-elon-musks-citizen-journalism">3.6 million people who have crossed into the U.S. illegally have been repatriated</a>&nbsp;since Biden took office. Soon after Musk’s visit, Biden announced that the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/us-resume-direct-deportation-flights-venezuelan-migrants-rcna119107">U.S. was resuming direct repatriation flights for Venezuelans</a>&nbsp;who unlawfully cross the border and have no legal basis to stay.</p>



<h2>An open border for all of Earth?</h2>



<p>The most troubling and sensationalist claim that Musk makes is that the U.S. southern border is an “<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1707565081750290910?s=20">open border for all of earth…an open border to 8 billion</a>.” Not only is this statement far from the truth, it plays into tropes that immigrants and refugees from the Global South are invading western countries.</p>



<p>It’s a dramatic misconception of the realities of global migration and displacement. The vast majority of refugees are hosted by countries in the Global South.</p>



<p>For example, displacement from <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/immigration-venezuela-refugee-crisis-us-border-policies/?fbclid=IwAR0qEfobBJ98gamFou7F0KpdQMo0XvcXivdfeccOs5NGC6-22oxyYbNnplI">Venezuela is now the largest refugee crisis</a> in the world, outpacing refugees from Ukraine and Syria. Of the <a href="https://www.r4v.info/es/refugiadosymigrantes">7.7 million displaced</a>, 85 per cent have moved to neighbouring Latin American countries. Only around <a href="https://www.r4v.info/es/refugiadosymigrantes">700,000 are in the U.S. under temporary protection status</a>, which is only nine per cent of the total displaced population.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed alignleft is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We actually do need a wall and we need to require people to have some shred of evidence to claim asylum to enter, as everyone is doing that. It’s a hack that you can literally Google to know exactly what to say!<br><br>Will find out more when I visit Eagle Pass maybe as soon as…</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1707146779894951982?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 27, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The claim that the U.S. border is open “for all of earth” is plainly wrong, and gives the U.S. credit for what has been a Latin American-led humanitarian response to the Venezuelan crisis.</p>



<p>Musk has been criticized for meddling in international affairs, most recently the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/21/23415242/elon-musk-starlink-ukraine-dod-twitter-david-sacks-russia">Ukraine war</a>. He has&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1576969255031296000?">tweeted a peace proposal</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/03/19/elon-musk-ukraine-starlink/">provided</a>&nbsp;then&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/07/ukraine-rips-musk-disrupting-sneak-attack-russian-navy.html">shut off Starlink’s satellite</a>&nbsp;network over Crimea and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/panoparker/status/1318157559266762752">seemingly supported</a>&nbsp;a U.S.-backed coup in Bolivia.</p>



<p>And we are seeing the implications for his misinformation at the border impact the lives of people seeking asylum in the U.S. being portrayed as “serial murderers” and “breaking the law.” As Musk wades into yet another political issue, it is crucial for the public to get their information from credible news sources and research, not billionaires on Twitter.</p>

<p>Canada’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/economic-mobility-pathways-pilot/immigrate/eligibility.html">Economic Mobility Pathways Pilot (EMPP)</a>, intended to settle skilled refugees to fill urgent Canadian labour shortages, risks commodifying refugees and humanitarianism. A shift towards using&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/canada-needs-to-stop-wasting-the-talent-of-skilled-immigrants-182005">an asylum claimant’s economic potential to judge their claim</a>&nbsp;risks blurring the lines between humanitarian- and economically-driven migration to Canada.</p>



<p>Canada has garnered international praise for the way it has welcomed refugees. The country has a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/canada-role/timeline.html">long history of granting protection to individuals fleeing persecution, war and violence</a>. Since 1980,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unhcr.ca/in-canada/refugees-in-canada/">Canada has welcomed over one million refugees</a>, and takes pride in their contributions to the Canadian economy and its multicultural milieu.</p>



<p>Canada’s welcoming approach, and its&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/the-story-behind-the-worlds-first-private-refugee-sponsorship-program-126257">private refugee sponsorship program</a>, have been touted as a model for other countries to follow. Canada has also been celebrated for its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fmreview.org/latinamerica-caribbean/dustin-ferreira">proceedings involving refugees who have suffered due to their sexual orientation or gender identity</a>.</p>



<p>Finding durable solutions to global refugee crises is a persistent challenge. However, admitting refugees based on their skills risks setting a dangerous precedent, and Canada would be wise to proceed with caution.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright"><a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/556956/original/file-20231031-29-iqfv1r.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip"><img src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/556956/original/file-20231031-29-iqfv1r.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" alt="A group of people holding signs that say welcome to Canada"/></a><figcaption>A family waits to welcome Syrian refugees at Toronto Pearson Airport. The EMPP risks jeopardizing Canada’s welcoming reputation.&nbsp;(Shutterstock)</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>Economic Mobility Pathways Pilot</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/economic-mobility-pathways-project-labour-mobility.html">The EMPP</a>&nbsp;was launched in April 2018 in collaboration with refugee-focused organizations like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.talentbeyondboundaries.org/">Talent Beyond Boundaries</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.refugepoint.org/">RefugePoint</a>, and is designed to combine refugee resettlement and economic immigration.</p>



<p>Through the EMPP, around 10 to 15 “skilled refugees” in the Middle East and East Africa were referred to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/provincial-nominees/works.html">provincial nominee programs</a>&nbsp;in Canada. Through these programs, Canadian provinces are able to nominate people for permanent residence. The EMPP was intended to be another avenue for refugees seeking to come to Canada.</p>



<p>In the summer of 2023, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) announced two new immigration streams under the EMPP. Refugees who secured a full-time job offer could come to Canada through the EMPP Skills Job Stream. Those without a full-time job offer, but who&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unhcr.ca/in-canada/other-immigration-pathways-refugees/economic-immigration-skilled-refugees/#:%7E:text=To%20date%2C%20a%20software%20developer,other%20applications%20are%20being%20processed.">possessed skills that match with employers’ needs</a>, could apply through the EMPP Federal Skills Without a Job Offer Stream.</p>



<p>These newer pathways apply a skills distinction to refugee selection and admission in Canada. Essentially, they distinguish refugee applicants based on their perceived skills, education, training and experience. Such a practice is counter to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/convention-relating-status-refugees">international</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/i-2.5/page-1.html#h-274085">national</a>&nbsp;protocols that state refugees must be protected based on their fears of persecution.</p>



<p>More importantly, distinguishing refugees in this way only serves the private interests of employers and businesses, and not necessarily those of asylum seekers.</p>



<h2>Making refugees prove their worth</h2>



<p>The government states the EMPP gives Canadian employers access to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/refugees/economic-mobility-pathways-pilot.html">“a new pool of qualified candidates”</a>&nbsp;who can meet ongoing labour shortages.</p>



<p>Migrant-receiving countries in the Global North have long relied on immigration to enhance their economic competitiveness. This economic basis for immigration has a long history in Canada and can be traced back to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/immigration-policy">1967 introduction of the points system</a>. Under this system, people seeking to immigrate to Canada are ranked and assessed based on their skills and human capital.</p>



<p>This kind of skilled immigration has become the&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/immigrants-could-be-the-solution-to-canadas-labour-shortage-but-they-need-to-be-supported-194613">preferred solution</a>&nbsp;to Canada’s ongoing labour shortages,&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/the-pandemic-created-challenges-and-opportunities-for-canadian-immigration-194490">particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>.</p>

<p>These immigration systems can often create power imbalances between companies and their workers that are ripe for abuse. They can often give employers significant say in&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/new-regulations-on-migrant-farm-workers-should-tackle-employer-employee-power-imbalances-198489">who gets to stay in Canada and who does not</a>.</p>



<h2>Risks of abuse</h2>



<p>Inserting labour market objectives into refugee policy means the federal government risks not fully considering the dangers of exposing already vulnerable refugees to increased trauma and exploitation by&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/canada-the-good-myth-exposed-migrant-workers-resist-debt-bondage-90279">employers or unregulated recruiters</a>.</p>



<p>Assessing a refugee based on their employment or economic prospects fails to consider their other needs,&nbsp;<a href="https://policyoptions.irpp.org/fr/magazines/mai-2016/from-newcomer-to-canadian-making-refugee-integration-work/">such as health care, housing and language training</a>. The current EMPP pathways remain small and are intended to complement, rather than replace, the humanitarian impetus driving Canada’s refugee policy.</p>



<p>Now is the time to stop, think and apply caution. There is a need for more dialogue on the potential risks for refugees if Canada starts to assess their applications based on their economic prospects rather than the depth of their humanitarian needs.</p>



<p>This is especially important as Canada could serve as a model for other countries, which it has done in the past, and shape the lives of global refugees.</p>

<p>Universities are playing an increasingly critical role in bringing researchers, policymakers, and practitioners together with staff, faculty, and students to foster the discovery, application, and translation of new knowledge to create stronger and healthier communities.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, York’s president and vice-chancellor, Rhonda Lenton, joined Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre’s (RVH) CEO, Gail Hunt, and Research Director Dr. Jesse McLean, to celebrate a shared commitment to advance medical education and health research through a <a href="https://www.rvh.on.ca/2023/10/rvh-and-york-university-sign-mou-to-promote-academic-teaching-and-applied-research/">Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that will deepen the ongoing partnership between the University and RVH</a>.</p>



<p>Health care is at the forefront of numerous complex societal challenges the next generation of changemakers must be prepared to address and is one of York University’s fastest-growing areas of study, research, and community engagement. “By leveraging our combined expertise and pooling our strengths in research and education,” says Lenton, “I am certain that we can improve health outcomes and make important contributions toward high-quality, sustainable, inclusive, and accessible health care for the communities we serve.”</p>



<p>Longstanding clinical-academic affiliates, York and RVH already have a deep history of working together to exchange resources and knowledge. In 2023 alone, RVH has provided clinical placements for 70 York students, while 32 York nursing students (from the York/Georgian College partnership) are finding employment and education in RVH’s Clinical Extern program.</p>



<p>“At RVH, we ask questions to promote new learnings, ideas, research and discovery,” says Hunt. “We challenge and push past what has always been done so we can offer better care for our patients, their families, our community, and region. This partnership opens the door for us to ‘imagine the possibilities’ as York University’s faculty and TEAM RVH grow in their own knowledge and skills through a variety of opportunities.”</p>

<p>Signed at a ceremony at the Barrie, Ontario hospital, the MOU builds on this rich partnership to support the continuation of clinical placements and real-world experiential education opportunities for York students, as well as increase collaborative research development in areas including mental health, informatics; epidemiology, disease etiology, aging, maternal and child health, health-care policy, nursing, and rehabilitative sciences, along with new health technologies, such as digital health and artificial intelligence.</p>



<p>The agreement also includes academic recognition for RVH staff and continuing education for RVH health-care professionals so they can continue to adapt and innovate as new technologies and advances emerge.</p>



<p>As home to one of Canada’s largest nursing and nurse practitioner programs; as well as world-class programs in psychology, kinesiology and health sciences, global health, health studies, health policy and management, health informatics, critical disability studies, and neuroscience; and, with plans for a proposed School of Medicine aiming to tackle the growing need for health-care professionals, York University has developed a longstanding reputation as a leader in health programming and research.</p>



<p>York and RVH are currently setting up additional student placements for the upcoming year.&nbsp;</p>
