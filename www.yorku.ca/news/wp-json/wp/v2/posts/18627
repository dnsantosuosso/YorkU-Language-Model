In 2023 alone, RVH has provided clinical placements for 70 York students, while 32 York nursing students (from the York\/Georgian College partnership) are finding employment and education in RVH\u2019s Clinical Extern program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAt RVH, we ask questions to promote new learnings, ideas, research and discovery,\u201d says Hunt. \u201cWe challenge and push past what has always been done so we can offer better care for our patients, their families, our community, and region. This partnership opens the door for us to \u2018imagine the possibilities\u2019 as York University\u2019s faculty and TEAM RVH grow in their own knowledge and skills through a variety of opportunities.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/www.yorku.ca\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/242\/2023\/11\/23-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"York University President and Vice-Chancellor Rhonda Lenton discusses how the MOU aims to create positive change by enhancing collaborative opportunities for faculty and students, to train the next generation of health professionals, and to improve outcomes for patients and communities.\" class=\"wp-image-18657\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.yorku.ca\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/242\/2023\/11\/23-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.yorku.ca\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/242\/2023\/11\/23-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.yorku.ca\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/242\/2023\/11\/23-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.yorku.ca\/news\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/242\/2023\/11\/23-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption><em>York University President and Vice-Chancellor Rhonda Lenton discusses how the MOU aims to create positive change by enhancing collaborative opportunities for faculty and students, to train the next generation of health professionals, and to improve outcomes for patients and communities.<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Signed at a ceremony at the Barrie, Ontario hospital, the MOU builds on this rich partnership to support the continuation of clinical placements and real-world experiential education opportunities for York students, as well as increase collaborative research development in areas including mental health, informatics; epidemiology, disease etiology, aging, maternal and child health, health-care policy, nursing, and rehabilitative sciences, along with new health technologies, such as digital health and artificial intelligence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The agreement also includes academic recognition for RVH staff and continuing education for RVH health-care professionals so they can continue to adapt and innovate as new technologies and advances emerge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As home to one of Canada\u2019s largest nursing and nurse practitioner programs; as well as world-class programs in psychology, kinesiology and health sciences, global health, health studies, health policy and management, health informatics, critical disability studies, and neuroscience; and, with plans for a proposed School of Medicine aiming to tackle the growing need for health-care professionals, York University has developed a longstanding reputation as a leader in health programming and research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>York and RVH are currently setting up additional student placements for the upcoming year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The MOU aims to create positive change by enhancing collaborative opportunities between York and RVH for faculty and students and to train the next generation of health professionals, to improve outcomes for patients and communities.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":391,"featured_media":18635,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"kt_blocks_editor_width":""},"categories":[4,401],"tags":[73,996],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.7 -
