<p><strong>Why did you decide to become a social worker?</strong></p>



<p>I didn’t decide to be a social worker, I think the profession chose me. I was raised by my grandmother, who is a community-oriented philanthropic. She raised a lot of kids, including me, and she exudes and embodies all the people-centered social worker values. Throughout my childhood, I saw the different ways she selflessly helped others and the work that she was doing for the community, all of which I attribute to my natural gravitation towards becoming a social worker, as it felt and continues to feel like home.</p>



<p>Originally, I grew up wanting to be a lawyer, but when I came to Canada in 2004, I started looking at York University’s School of Social Work and in the end, chose social work instead and I haven’t looked back. I worked hand in hand with lawyers when I was in child protection and that experience was sufficient to affirm that I made a great choice by veering away from law. &nbsp;For me, social work is walking alongside people and bearing witness to their multi-layered and multistoried journeys of life, and after reflecting on how I was raised and the values that I have, it just made sense for me, it felt like a divine assignment or calling.</p>



<p><strong>Could you talk about your social work journey and how it led you to your current position(s)?</strong></p>



<p>I started my Bachelors of Social Work (BSW) in 2005 and then completed my Masters of Social Work (MSW) in 2010 and during that time, I got married and two of our children were born. When I was in my BSW I delivered our first child and went back to class six days later. When I was completing my MSW, I came back to class three weeks later! Throughout my university education, I felt very supported by my professors and found a way to juggle all these roles while also attending classes, completing my readings and papers, and in the end, I was still able to graduate with my class!</p>



<p>My first placement was with Community Legal Aid on York’s campus. As you can see, the lawyer theme came back! I remember noticing that my field instructor had BSW, MSW, RSW which really inspired me to finish my MSW, a goal that seemed distantly unreachable at that time.</p>



<p>After completing my MSW, I worked in child protection in both Windsor and Hamilton. Throughout these roles, I always reminded myself that I’m here to support and help my clients through a tough time in their lives. I remember one instance with a client where if I had reported what was going on in her home, I would have had to apprehend the child, but I opted to roll up my sleeves and help her clean the house, which was not in my job description. &nbsp;After the cleaning was done, we took some before and after photos to show how her home could be kept safe for her child.</p>



<p>My next job opportunity took me to Alberta because there were plenty of social work opportunities in mental health. Fortunately, I ended up getting a lot of interviews which presented me with choice. Currently, I’m still in Alberta and work as a mental health therapist for Alberta Health Services, which is part of the provincial government. I also have my own private practice, where I also do clinical supervision and consultation. Owning a practice and being a consultant allows me to be very versatile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In my practice, I mostly concentrate on supporting people who are marginalized including those who are racialized as Black and Indigenous Peoples, as well as people who are gender diverse and sexually expansive. I have dubbed myself an Africentric Cultural Safety Consultant.</p>



<p>I’m also a co-founder of a non-profit organization called Alberta Black Therapist Network and a co-founder of Alafia Consulting Inc., which is another mental health consultant organization where we focus on the needs of minoritized folks and provide varied psycho-educational workshops. I've noticed that Western Psychology focuses on individual healing, but in reality, we need a community, as no one really exists as an island. I find that by incorporating non-Eurocentric modalities, there is a pathway to collective healing, which is the focus of my private practice.</p>



<p><strong>Can you talk more about your current position? What are some challenges you face?</strong></p>



<p>As I’m working in different capacities, I’m careful to not set this as a standard way of practice since it is a recipe for burnout. Although I have a lot on the go, my work is very heart-centred, and I really believe in what I’m doing. I enjoy supporting the community in various ways and so it really doesn’t feel like work since I truly love what I do. &nbsp;Lastly, I'm careful about who I work for and affiliate myself with, because when we look at the foundation of social work, it has strong roots in colonialism and oppression, so I don't like to work with organizations that are into performative diversity, allyship and lip service with no action.</p>



<p>The biggest challenge in opening my private practice was to figure everything out by myself. The community aspect is missing in my private practice, and COVID-19 only increased that isolation, not to mention that the political climate also became very troubling. There's a lot of secrecy and competition amongst the clinicians, where people don’t readily share information which only increases feelings of loneliness. If we all worked together, we could really support each other to help our respective communities.</p>



<p>In my regular job, as a mental health therapist, I mainly work with children and adolescents. My position really changed with COVID-19 because the feelings of isolation were felt by everyone. The biggest challenge for me is working in a rural setting and being one of the only therapists for children in my area. My children attending the local schools where I work is also another challenge. When you move to a small town, you don’t really think about this being an issue until it’s birthday parties and playdates and there is a conflict of interest you have to manage.</p>



<p>One of the major challenges is starting your own private practice or business. From figuring out taxes, human resources, and marketing - I had to learn swiftly through trial and error.</p>



<p><strong>What were some of your main takeaways after completing your degrees at York University’s social work program?</strong></p>



<p>To be completely honest, I was in auto pilot because I was juggling pregnancy, child raising, schoolwork and a part-time job, most of that experience is fuzzy and to this day I don't know how I completed it!</p>



<p>What I do remember was how accommodating the professors were and the learning process and energy that most of the professors brought to class was impactful. I remember that in one of my courses, the professor started each day with a mindfulness exercise, which at the time I thought was weird, but looking back, it was effective. The professors were quite diverse, and this was important to me.</p>



<p>I really enjoyed the focus on social justice, critical social work and having the opportunity to complete my placement within some of the local communities. York University’s social work program doesn’t have a specialization, which I appreciated as it gave me the opportunity to spread my wings and explore various social work careers. This is why I was able to start in child protection and then move into mental health. One of the program's strengths is that it helps students to work in a variety of social work settings and they can be quite versatile.</p>



<p>Critical social work helps in my practice every day. I work with people who have marginalized identities and so I’m constantly asking myself how I can create a space that is culturally and psychologically safe. &nbsp;I think about what my private practice embodies, and it comes from the critical social perspective that I was taught at York University: identity-affirming, culturally responsive, anti-oppressive, interculturally inclusive and decolonial.</p>



<p><strong>How do you practice self-care, and could you share some tips for students and new grads?</strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;I think self-care is a buzzword that needs to be decolonized, and people rarely talk about what it fundamentally means and entails. I think it was created in a culture where we put a lot of responsibility on individuals, so when people are working in environments that are not supportive or toxic, we still expect them to care for themselves and do the best that they can. This line of thinking unintentionally puts the blame on individuals by telling them that all they need to do is care for themselves, even when they are in environments that are psychologically harmful and not conducive to self-care.</p>



<p><br>A healthier way to look at self-care is through the lens of community care. When the community is supportive and inclusive, then it’s easier for people to take care of themselves. For example, when people must code-switch to assimilate and conform to the dominant culture, then it isn’t safe for them, it feels hypocritical for us to prescribe self-care as the solution. &nbsp;I believe that the mind, body, and spirit are all intertwined, and we need to ensure that each aspect of a person is taken care of and acknowledged. Self-care goes beyond massages and going to the gym, it’s looking at the different pieces of an individual that feeds their soul.</p>



<p>I have learned that self-care to me is doing the things that make me feel whole as a person, for example, being connected with family and friends. Having support around me and acknowledging that it takes a village for me to be me. Also creating boundaries, for example, even if I’m online, it doesn't mean that people are entitled to my time, if you send me an email outside my working hours, I don’t need to respond right away. I could go and on, but self-care is knowing that I am you and you are me, a concept that is grounded in UBUNTU, an African way of being and knowing that emphasizes our shared humanity, collective resilience, and interconnectedness as one human race.</p>



<p><strong>What advice would you give to a social work graduate?</strong></p>



<p>I would advise a new social worker to welcome every opportunity with courage, compassion, and curiosity. When you approach a situation with an open mind, let go of societal binaries, absolutes, and dichotomies, let the journey lead the way. Listen to your body and ask; ‘Am I where I need to be and what is being communicated to me at this very moment?’. Unfortunately, there is no magic pill or formula to doing social work, all the learning and unlearning will happen beyond the classroom. Seek mentorship and supervision from those who are ahead of you to learn what you can from them as you forge your own journey and find your own style as a social worker. Lastly, say yes to opportunities that align with your core and don't be afraid to walk away from workplaces that force you to shrink your brilliance.</p>



<p>I take pride in sharing that I am a therapist who is actively in therapy, which is a gentle reminder for other social workers that they are human too and there is value in working on themselves as much as helping others. I am a supervisor who is in supervision, and I am also involved in mentorship with fellow social workers, hence I am not solely self-made, but community-made and ancestor validated. I am because they are.</p>

<h2><strong>Can you spend a few minutes talking about your dissertation topic and research?</strong> </h2>



<p>My dissertation is called “Aging, Black, and Lonely: A Narrative Experience of Black Older Adults in Canada”. My research helped to fill a gap where Black older adults have not been included in loneliness research within Canada. I focused on their experiences with loneliness, how they cope, and what factors contribute to their feeling of loneliness. I also looked at the extent to which they are involved and participate, highlighting the constellating factors that contribute to their lack of social participation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I adopted a sandwich method which yielded four papers. The first paper “Understanding Social and Emotional Loneliness about Black Older Adults - A Scoping Review” explored the range of research available on loneliness among Black older adults on a global level. Some major themes that emerged from the review showed that loneliness amongst Black older adults is a factor of poor health, poor socioeconomic status, weak social integration, and weak attachments. The review also revealed the lack of research evidence on this area in Canada, giving rise to the qualitative studies included in my dissertation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The remaining three papers adopted a qualitative method with 13 participants who live in Ontario using narrative methodology. The first of these papers which is the second paper in my dissertation and titled “The Narrative Exploration of Loneliness in Black Older Adults Living in Ontario,” focused on understanding the in-depth experience of social and emotional loneliness guided by the social provision framework developed by Robert Weiss. This framework proposes 6 types of social provisions or relational gains that could mitigate or contribute to loneliness. They include social integration, guidance, reliable alliance, opportunity for nurturance, attachment, and reassurance of worth. This paper showed that Black older adults’ experience of loneliness goes beyond these social provisions. As such, part of my research recommendation was expanding and making the theory culturally relevant for racialized people as this wasn’t originally taken into consideration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third paper titled “You’re not Understood, and you are Isolated, a Narrative account of Loneliness by Black Older Adults in Ontario Canada,” discusses different factors that shift the experience of loneliness among Black older adults and how they cope with their experience of loneliness. My research introduces the use of the 3-dimensional space narrative inquiry framework in studying loneliness. Specifically, my research uncovered how Black older adults’ experiences of loneliness is shaped by three elements of time, place, and interaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The final paper titled “A narrative analysis of exclusion from social participation and loneliness among Black older adults in Ontario, Canada,” explores the social participation and underrepresentation of Black older adults in existing programs and services in Ontario, guided by the representational intersectionality framework.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What are some of your major findings?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, Black older adults mentioned the importance of being with people who are reliable, credible, and who can provide help, care, support, intimacy, and security should anything happen to them, as many of the participants are living in Canada alone while their families currently reside in Africa and the Caribbean.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, participants spoke a lot about the sense of belonging, identity, and how the lack of these aspects, can contribute to loneliness. I found that amongst Black older adults, there’s a high experience of loneliness as they don’t feel like Canada is home because of the treatment they’ve received from community members or when job searching. On top of this, they also experience racism, ageism, and exclusion. These intersecting systems of oppression and marginalization only exacerbates their feelings of loneliness. That is why many of them would say, “why do I need to care, let me stay on my own, I don't need to get involved because they don't need me”. Also, Black older adults emphasized the lack of culturally relevant programs and services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another interesting thing that participants mentioned was the shifting color code, where they had to keep changing their identity to suit the dominant culture of whiteness that exists within the Eurocentric society. They also mentioned that they tried to please people outside their community to feel accepted and have a sense of belonging, and this exacerbates their experiences of loneliness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I asked one of the participants about her thoughts about how Black older adults have been excluded in existing services and programs, she said that “we shouldn’t be talking about exclusion because we have never been included from the onset, we have never been made relevant. So why should we be talking about that?” There is an urgent need for programs that specifically address the needs and cultural practices of Black older adults and emphasize the need to factor in diversity, cultural sensitivity and security while designing and developing programs and service for racialized older adults. The only way that this can happen is by bringing Black older adults to the table when decisions are being made.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was also interested in how Black older adults cope as they make Canada home and how they build resilience across time. I found that the participants experiences changed depending on how many years the person has lived in Canada, when they arrived, and their immigration status as it determines the services you have access to. For example, for people who moved to Canada with their family 30-50 years ago as an international student, they felt a lot of exclusion, inequities, and disparities in services, but over time, they were able to build resilience, increase their access to services, and adapt. For these people, over time, their experiences of loneliness were drastically reduced, and they are now caring for people who have just arrived in Canada. But for older adults who just recently arrived in Canada, their experience of loneliness is doubled because of the multiple roadblocks that they have to face, including in employment and accessibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Can you believe that the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) only recently started to collect data on race! Currently only about 5% of the data comes from the Black community. There is an urgent need for data that is representative. In October 2022, I attended the Canadian Association of Gerontology Conference (CAG) and asked one of the presenters why the data isn’t representative. He said that because of systemic issues, only a small group of people decided whose voices will be made visible and whose would be invisible. This is why in my research; it was important that I interviewed people from different countries in Africa, the West Indies and Black Canadian-born, as I wanted to have a demographically diverse sampling. It really makes the research much more equitable and representative.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What inspired you to apply for the MSW program after completing your PhD, and why did you choose York’s School of Social Work?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>I completed my BSW in Nigeria, my master's degree in Gerontology, and my PhD in Social Gerontology, but I always wanted to come back to social work. Many of my family and friends questioned my decision complete an MSW program after my PhD, but I knew that having an MSW will help me to teach gerontology in social work, and I also wanted to be a registered social worker in Canada. Also, during my PhD, I was exposed to different forms of learning and pedagogy which used more of a clinical approach and so I needed a school which focuses on a critical or anti-oppressive lens. I finally made up my mind to complete my MSW at York because one of my professors at McMaster University, where I completed my PhD, told me that York’s social work program is number one if you want to learn from a critical lens! It also helps that York provides a funding package which gives me the opportunity to concentrate on school without having to worry about how to pay the bills.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How do you see the MSW Program supporting your PhD topic?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>My PhD focuses on anti-oppression, social justice, and representational intersectionality, by using a critical social work lens at York, I felt that this best supports my research. I also wanted to be in a program that furthered my knowledge in these areas. Throughout my thesis, I really focused on social justice, and it was very important for me to emphasize the need for representation of Black older adults and to address their needs. Someone needed to give Black older adults a voice, as it has always been hidden. I felt like York’s critical social work is a fundament tool to further that mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are not many schools that teach about the aging experiences of Black older adults using race as a lens to teach gerontology. I want to be the person that teaches gerontology, while bringing in race, disempowerment, and marginalization. It's been very exciting seeing the responses that my research is receiving. After presenting my findings at the CAG Conference, I received the longest applause!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What advice would you give to someone who is considering applying to a PhD program?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Number one piece of advice is to choose a supervisor that has your interests at heart, as it’s a big factor in the success of your PhD. It is important to find a supervisor who's available and who understands what you are doing. Secondly, choose a topic that will bring you fulfillment and that really interests and excites you. The third piece of advice is that completing a PhD is not your life and it’s important to make time for yourself, your mental health, and your family/friends’, creating balance is very crucial.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What’s Next for you?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are not a lot of people who study and teach gerontology and there is a need for more people to be doing this work. In social work, there’s a temptation to pay more attention to the younger population but we are doing it at the detriment of the older population. They are being ignored neglected, no one is talking about them. My goal is to teach gerontology and increase the curriculum in this area and further progress this research within social work. I would be so glad to be that gerontological social work voice in a Canadian School of Social work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kristen is serving as the Executive Director of Practice and Research Together, a national non-profit knowledge translation organization for child welfare.&nbsp; Kristen has led the development of a curriculum focused on promoting research evidence use in child welfare.&nbsp; Kristen has over twenty years of clinical experience with victims of crime and in the child welfare system and child welfare research and evaluation. Kristen's research is focused on how child welfare worker and organizational factors effect service user outcomes. Kristen has a Doctorate in social work from the University of Toronto.</p>
<h2><strong>Can you tell me your path to social work?<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>My education was not a direct line to social work.&nbsp; My first degree was in psychology, and after completing the degree I was not sure what line of work I wanted to get into.&nbsp; So, knowing I wanted to get into a helping profession, I entered the Assaulted Women and Children Counsellor Advocate Program at the college level.&nbsp; This diploma gave me the opportunity to work with victims and witnesses within the justice system - an amazing learning experience.&nbsp; Being in this type of work I was able to see the impact of systemic oppression and wanted to learn more.&nbsp; I knew that social work was the place for learning about how the environment - micro, meso, and macro - may impact people and how they experience the world.&nbsp; Both direct and indirect social work are so important to promoting well-being of individuals and families and equality among our communities.</p>
<h2><strong>Why did you want to become the ED of Practice and Research Together (PART)?</strong></h2>
<p>After working as a child welfare worker for many years and then working in child welfare research and evaluation, PART seemed like a logical fit for me.&nbsp; PART brings together child welfare work and research, using evidence-informed practice.&nbsp; It is so important for child welfare workers, or any social workers, to incorporate research into their daily practice.&nbsp; If we, as a field, are committed to ethical social work, research must be a part of our practice.&nbsp; Research is not a panacea, but we have a duty to access, understand, and think critically about whether it applies to our practice.&nbsp; Also, I love research!</p>
<h2><strong>What interested you in supervising students with the School of Social Work at York University?</strong></h2>
<p>I am interested in supervising students from all schools of social work.&nbsp; Each university provides a different perspective and offers something unique.&nbsp; In my experience, students from York University have the unique ability to apply theory to practice.&nbsp; Practice and Research Together (PART) is a knowledge translation and mobilization organization, so we are focused on developing resources for social workers, requiring the skill of applying what is learned in the classroom to the resources we create.&nbsp; Practicum students from York University have excelled in this area and &nbsp;demonstrated the ability to think critically.</p>

<h2><strong>What have been some of your favourite supervision moments?</strong></h2>
<p>Over the years, I have had so many favourite supervision moments that make me smile.&nbsp; One great moment was when a York student presented a critical thinking exercise that he developed, to a group of 120 people attending our conference.&nbsp; The exercise was amazing, and participants loved it.&nbsp; Another moment is when we were having our final supervision of the placement and our student wrote us a song!&nbsp; He sang us the song about what he learned at PART and about research and critical thinking.&nbsp; Lastly, one of my favourite moments are when students have a light bulb moment about critical thinking and the use of research in social work practice.&nbsp; The hope is that students realize the importance of incorporating research in practice and how to incorporate critical thinking into everything they do.&nbsp; This is the moment students feel empowered.</p>
<h2><strong>What has been some of the best advice you have provided to students about bridging practice and theory?</strong></h2>
<p>I think that the importance of critical thinking is the best learning that happens at PART.&nbsp; We are all about bridging practice and theory, which really comes from critical thinking.&nbsp; This is not so much a piece of advice, but rather a key process required for social work practice, direct or indirect.&nbsp; This learning comes from questioning one’s self – our learning, assumptions, beliefs, and how and whether this should be applied to our practice.</p>
<h2><strong>Sometimes the agencies we work for can be bureaucratic and feel top down at times.&nbsp; Is this something you have experienced?&nbsp; How do you manage and negotiate this for yourself and the students you supervise?</strong></h2>
<p>Similar to many social workers, I have experienced bureaucratic work environments.&nbsp; Learning to navigate bureaucracy has taken time, but what keeps me going is the knowledge that it is families accessing services that are ultimately impacted by our services.&nbsp; There are organizational processes that may be frustrating, but in the end will support families.&nbsp; These types of bureaucracies are time consuming, but we just must be patient.&nbsp; There are other bureaucracies that do not consider the well-being of families we serve – these are the processes that as social workers we need to question and ultimately link back to the ethics of social work.</p>
<h2><strong>What tips do you provide students you supervise about practicing self-care?</strong></h2>
<p>We are lucky that at PART we have a relaxed environment.&nbsp; We learn about self-care in school, which is important.&nbsp; In my experience, the most important thing I could do was stick to my ethics.&nbsp; For me, the most distressing aspect about direct practice was the systemic barriers that families faced in everyday life.&nbsp; Focusing on families’ strengths and building relationships allowed me to recognize the importance of my work.</p>
<h2><strong>What have you learned from the students you supervise?&nbsp; How have they inspired you?</strong></h2>
<p>I learn something from every student we supervise – to be more patient, to go slower, to take action, to be more explicit, and to recognize how we can make our work better in the moment.&nbsp; Every student has inspired me in a different way and has (hopefully) made me a better supervisor.</p>
<h2><strong>What advice would you give to new social worker graduates?</strong></h2>
<p>Be open – be open to different areas of social work, be open to a job you may not have considered when you began the social work program, be open to meeting people in various areas of social work, be open to not knowing.&nbsp; Take all of these experiences – good and bad – and learn from them.&nbsp; These experiences will shape you as a social worker and better equip you to serve the families in your community.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4><strong><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; color: #376092;"> The School of Social Work unequivocally supports the statement issued by the Race Equity Caucus of YUFA condemning a recent incident of racist Islamophobic incitement at York University, and urge all members of the York community to do the same</span></strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; color: #376092;"><b>Race Equity Caucus statement:</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; color: #376092;">On this, the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the Race Equity Caucus (REC) of YUFA condemns a recent incident of racist Islamophobic incitement at York University, an institution with one of the largest populations of Muslim students in the country. An unidentified person wore a Make American Great Again (MAGA) hat to a vigil mourning those 50 Muslims, including children, who were murdered by a white supremacist at the Al-Noor Mosque and the Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand. We, the REC, understand the wearing of the MAGA hat to be a deliberate act of affront and racist hate towards the students, faculty and all those assembled in mourning the lives taken through Islamophobic violence.&nbsp; The MAGA hat is a symbol of white supremacy.&nbsp; This was demonstrated recently by the white youths who mocked Nathan Phillips at the Indigenous Peoples March at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. in January. The person who wore a MAGA hat to a vigil at York University demonstrated a cruel contempt for the mourners and support for Islamophobic violence and death. We call on the York University administration and YUFA to immediately condemn Islamophobic violence and harassment, including the wearing of symbols of white supremacist hatred such as the MAGA hat.</span></p>
