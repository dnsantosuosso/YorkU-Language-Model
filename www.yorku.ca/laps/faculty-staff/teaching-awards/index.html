<p><strong>Congratulations to the winners of the 2020-2021 Dean’s Awards for Excellence in Teaching</strong></p>



<p><strong>Andrea Kalmin </strong>was recognized in the Teaching Assistant category<strong>. </strong>Professor Kalmin teaches in the Department of Social Science, where she prioritizes a community of practice that is grounded in understanding and empathy. She considers it an honour and privilege to facilitate and advance meaningful and engaging teaching and learning experiences for York’s undergraduate students. Dedicated to embodying a growth mindset and enacting it in the classroom, what excites her most these days is the ability to collaborate with like-minded educators and innovators. She is inspired (and consistently impressed) by our student leaders, who are seeking to work together to make a difference and have a real-world impact. This passion has led to her ongoing interest in SoTL research, her teaching involvement in C4 (Cross-Campus Capstone Classroom) and an emerging relationship with the York Capstone Network. She is grateful to be part of York’s vibrant community of teachers and learners.</p>



<p>Department of Social Science <strong>Professor Ryan James</strong>, with the Department of Social Sciences, was recognized in the Contract/Adjunct/CLA category. James is an anthropologist and a course director in the Urban Studies Program. His goal as an educator is to provide space for students to empower themselves by thinking critically, and by developing the research, communications, and analytical skills it will take to understand social problems and challenge social inequity in the 2020s and beyond. His current teaching is focused on urban social movements, cities in popular culture, and climate change adaption and mitigation.</p>



<p>When classes moved online in 2020, James reconceptualized the lecture component of his courses as a series of YouTube videos. To boost interest and engagement, he added music, visuals, and other effects to the videos, and made them available to the public. “My goal is to make the video lectures look like something people would watch on YouTube because they want to,” James said. “Through my own prior experiences as a first-generation university student, I’ve seen how relatable and accessible content can inspire and motivate students facing barriers.”</p>



<p><strong>Professor <a href="https://profiles.laps.yorku.ca/profiles/tkarag/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tsvetanka Karagyozova</a> </strong>received an award in the Tenured/Tenure Stream.

His focus is on Leadership: Race and Leadership, non-profit organizations, and community development and engagement.

<p><strong>Professor Paul Brienza</strong> received an honourable mention in the Contract/Adjunct/CLA category. Brienza teaches in the Department of Equity Studies. Professor Brienza has had a career of teaching excellence that is reflected in the awards mentioned as well as in a stellar commitment to the continuing enhancement of the learning experience of students. This has involved him in the continuous refinement of the classroom experience through the use of innovative pedagogical methodologies, technological linkages, and critical insights that continue to inspire students to achieve academic excellence. Brienza has developed a unique classroom strategy that allows for the integration of “critical” and “progressive” perspectives on the history and context of Human Rights and its practice in an increasingly complex global environment. This pedagogical strategy is combined with an intense research and scholarly commitment that has led Dr. Brienza to explore the conceptual history of Human Rights discourse through the publication of several theoretically oriented monographs and journal articles. The recent publication of <em>The Ontology of the Norm: Essays in the Philosophy of Human Rights</em> has allowed for Brienza to bridge the gap between classroom and scholarship. At present, he is also working on a text that is slated for publication in early 2022 and that surveys the intellectual history of the idea of Human Rights. Dr. Brienza has had a sustained commitment to the Faculty of LA&amp;PS through his extensive work on the creation of an innovative and unique Critical Human Rights MA degree. His commitment to improving the profile and standing of the Department of Equity Studies as well as the Faculty and York University is unwavering. Brienza seeks to combine academic excellence with participatory expansion and student growth now and in future endeavours.</p>

Earning her this esteemed honour, the Black Canadian Studies Certificate program provides students with an examination of the historical expressive productions of people of African descent. Thanks to her ongoing efforts, courses in the program take innovative humanities and fine arts approaches in the way they are taught – exploring music, literature and other cultural contributions. “It was an incredible honour to receive the inaugural Ann Shteir Prize in recognition of my work and students’ advocacy in centring Black Canadian studies into the curriculum,” Davis said. “York is uniquely positioned to take leadership in transforming the curriculum to address the needs of our diverse students. I’m glad to have played a small role in that transformation.”</p>

<p><strong>Congratulations to the winners of the 2016-2017 Dean’s Awards for Excellence in Teaching:</strong></p>



<p><strong><a href="https://profiles.laps.yorku.ca/profiles/kherajs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Professor Sean Kheraj</a></strong> from the Department of History received the Award for Excellence in Teaching in the Tenured Faculty category. A highly-respected professor who teaches Canadian, environmental and digital histories, Kheraj brings innovative and technologically savvy strategies to the classroom.</p>



<p>“Universities are exciting because they are one of the very few institutions in Canadian society devoted to the exploration of ideas and the production of knowledge,” said Kheraj. “Students should walk away with both new knowledge and new skills.”</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://profiles.laps.yorku.ca/profiles/gcolby/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Professor Gordana Colby</a></strong> from the Department of Economics received the teaching excellence award in the Contract Faculty category. A passionate and committed educator, she champions new and fruitful ways to foster student success and improve the quality of the first-year experience.</p>



<p>“I am most passionate about inspiring each student to engage and connect with the material,” said Colby. “In order to do this, it is really important that the classroom, be it a physical room or a virtual space, is an inclusive, comfortable, respectful and engaging place to be.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<p>PhD student Vedrana Cetina, in the Department of Philosophy, was recognized in the Teaching Assistant category. Whether she’s teaching in a large lecture hall or speaking one-on-one, she is known for motivating students and making philosophy both compelling and comprehensible.</p>



<p>“What I enjoy most is to foster student’s growth,” said Cetina. “I see teaching as a unique opportunity not only to explore different philosophical theories, but also to witness and attend to my student’s growth both as critical thinkers and human beings.”</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://profiles.laps.yorku.ca/profiles/sylwiac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Professor Sylwia Chrostowska</a></strong> from the Department of Humanities received the Award for Distinction in Research in the Emerging Researcher Category. She is widely recognized by her peers for successfully straddling the divide between academic writing and literature.</p>



<p>“Scholarly research can be written up as a standard article or book, but it can also feed into more creative forms of writing, as in my case,” said Chrostowska. “Creative or literary writing, which privileges the imagination but isn’t simply ‘fiction’, has led me to insights I might not have had otherwise.”</p>



<p><a href="https://profiles.laps.yorku.ca/profiles/amacla/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Professor Alice MacLachlan</strong></a> from the Department of Philosophy was also recognized in the Emerging Researcher Category.

<p>“The world is becoming smaller and the presence of China looms ever larger in so many spheres of our lives: Chinese medicine is becoming mainstream, for example, and China’s economic power is shaping global commercial and political relations,” said Judge. “In order to understand China today, it’s critical to understand not just the broad outlines of this history and culture, but the ways history and culture are being used, understood and politicized in China today.”</p>
</div></div>



<p><a href="https://profiles.laps.yorku.ca/profiles/hassanq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Professor Hassan Qudrat-Ullah</strong></a> from the School of Administrative Studies was honoured in the Established Researcher category. A highly prolific researcher in the field of decision sciences and system dynamics approach, he is skilled at mobilizing resources to establish his own innovative research niche.</p>

Known for her ground-breaking work on the experiences of migrant workers in Canada, she exemplifies the spirit of social justice.</p>



<p>“Over the last 15 to 20 years there has been a dramatic change in Canadian policies around immigration, refugees and citizenship. After about 35 years of being a country with most newcomers arriving as permanent residents, Canada began to see a dramatic increase in temporary migration,” said Goldring. “Our work on non-citizen precarious immigration and legal status trajectories offers empirical evidence about an understudied population and a process not captured in official statistics. Our work contributes qualitative and quantitative data on the systemic and long-term challenges faced by people with precarious status. Our work also supports efforts to expand access to education for precarious status youth living in Canada.”</p>
