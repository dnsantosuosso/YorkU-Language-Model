He is a two-time Giller Prize winner (1994 and 2003) and the 1990 Commonwealth Writers Prize for The Gunny Sack and in 2004 was awarded the Trillium prize for his most recent novel. Vassanji, born in Kenya, Nairobi and raised in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, draws on his experience to explore questions of identity and experience in the Arab-Indian culture, taking on the larger thematic concerns of the intersections between past and present, the assimilation of traditional and contemporary values and the importance of love and safety, conditions that arise out of a sense of community. Indeed, one of the preoccupations in his fiction is the evolution of community from the perspective of the 'ordinary' life caught in the vortex of overwhelming historical events that engulf it. Vassanji has a distinguished international reputation and has established the Toronto South Asian Review to support South Asian Canadian writers and has a doctorate in nuclear physics. Of The In-Between World of Vikram Lall, Janette Turner Hospital wrote: "His characters are complex, compelling, revelatory and unforgettable.It is a wounded but quietly stubborn humanity, this refusal to cast single blame on the multifarious injustice that puts Vassanji in Tolstoy's company. Of his own work, Vassanji has said, "I write at night but think about it all the time."</p>

His Louis Riel: A Comic-Strip Biography (2003), inspired in part by Maggie Siggins. Riel: A Life of Revolution, delivers a cartoon narrative that is entertaining and extensively researched. The story of one of Canada's controversial figures takes on a contemporary context, rendered in the form of a graphic narrative. Brown is also known as a pioneer in the world of underground comics with bizarre and surreal titles. Series like Yummy Fur and Underwater and I Never Liked You contain a strong autobiographical component and project a trenchant political and cultural critique, inviting comparisons with the serialized novel associated with Charles Dickens. In 2004 Chester Brown received three prestigious Harvey Awards for his work: Best Writer (Louis Riel), Best Cartoonist (Louis Riel) and Best Graphic Album of previously published works.</p>



<p>Nov. 25 George Szanto</p>



<p>George Szanto is the award-winning author of a dozen books, novels, stories, plays and essays who holds a doctorate in comparative literature from Harvard (Woodrow Wilson Fellow). He has been a Fellow of the Royal Society since 1988. Szanto's first novel, Not Working (St. Martin.s Press, Macmillan, Avon) was short-listed for the Books in Canada First Novel Award. Friends and Marriages (Véhicule) won the Hugh MacLennan Prize for Fiction (1995) and The Underside of Stories (McClelland &amp; Stewart, Harper &amp; Row) won a National Magazine Award. Szanto.s important fictional trilogy Conquests of Mexico (The Underside of Stones, 1990, The Condesa of M., 2001 and Second Sight, 2004) explores the mystical, religious, and political facets in Mexican culture translated through the voice of the outsider/foreigner, a criminologist named George, who functions as the collector or caretaker of the truth. This literary stance mirrors Szanto.s own research and preoccupation with the "horror stories" coming out of Chiapas and the Peru-Ecuador story. Szanto was born in Derry, Northern Ireland, and has lived in England, France, Germany, Mexico, the US and Canada. In the seventies, Szanto was the executive director of New Heritage Theatre in San Diego, later serving as president of Playwrights of Canada. In Montreal he taught at McGill as a professor of communications and cultural analysis before moving to Gabriola Island in British Columbia.</p>
