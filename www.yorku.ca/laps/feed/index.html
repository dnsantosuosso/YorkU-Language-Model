<p>Andrea McKenzie, associate professor and Chair of the Writing Department in the Faculty of Liberal Arts &amp; Professional Studies at York University, has been asked by the Western Front Association (WFA) to place a wreath in honour of Canadian nurses at the Cenotaph in London, England, in Nov. 11 ceremonies honouring veterans of the First World War.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>The Cenotaph is a war memorial unveiled in 1920 as the United Kingdom’s national memorial to the dead of Britain and the British Empire of the First World War. In 1946 it was designated to include the fallen from the Second World War. The memorial has become a central location for the annual services organized on Remembrance Sunday – the U.K. equivalent of Canada’s Remembrance Day – where crowds gather to observe two minutes of silence, and wreaths are laid by distinguished representatives to honour the fallen.</p>



<p>The invitation to place a wreath honouring the role of Canadian nurses during the First World War is, in part, a recognition of McKenzie’s ongoing work and expertise around the subject. In the past, McKenzie has provided articles and presentations to the WFA – both in person and virtually – on the sometimes little known or unrecognized role Canadian nurses played in the conflict. It was <a href="https://www.nam.ac.uk/whats-on/bluebirds-war-canadian-nurses-first-world-war" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2018 event at the National Army Museum</a> in London that first drew WFA organizer’s attention to McKenzie’s work, and led now to the invitation to place a wreath in this year’s Remembrance Sunday’s ceremony.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:33.33%">
<div class="wp-block-image img-thumbnail rounded-0"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="350" height="350" src="https://www.yorku.ca/laps/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2023/11/Andrea-McKenzie.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-371649" srcset="https://www.yorku.ca/laps/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2023/11/Andrea-McKenzie.jpg 350w, https://www.yorku.ca/laps/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2023/11/Andrea-McKenzie-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.yorku.ca/laps/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2023/11/Andrea-McKenzie-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /><figcaption>Andrea McKenzie</figcaption></figure></div>
</div>
</div>



<p>Following the ceremony and the laying of her wreath, McKenzie will read a poem to dignitaries at the Guards’ Chapel in Westminster as part of a service to commemorate veterans who served during the First World War, those who were lost in the war and those who mourned them.</p>



<p>McKenzie’s ongoing work has also included numerous publications and lectures about Canadian nurses’ experiences during the First World War in Canada and Europe. She is also the author and editor of <em>War-Torn Exchanges: The Lives and Letters of Nursing Sisters Laura Holland and Mildred Forbes </em>(UBC Press, 2016), a book of letters written by Canadian nurses during the First World War.</p>

<p>Paul McLaughlin, an award-winning writer and course director at Writing Department, Faculty of LA&amp;PS, has released <em>The Suicide Magnet: Inside the Battle to Erect a Safety Barrier on Toronto’s Bloor Viaduct</em>, which details the history of the barrier and the citizen volunteers who advocated for its existence.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>From 1918 to 1997, Toronto’s Prince Edward Viaduct (more commonly referred to as the Bloor Viaduct) was once considered the second most used suicide bridge in North America. During that time frame nearly 500 individuals used it to end their lives.</p>



<p>McLaughlin’s new book recounts the story of how a group of volunteers led by two citizens – Al Birney and Michael McCamus ­– underwent a six-year journey to advocate to help those with mental health challenges, and push Toronto’s City Hall to fund and construct a suicide barrier on the bridge.</p>



<p><em>The Suicide Magnet&nbsp;</em>is the latest achievement for McLaughlin in an award-winning career that has spanned more than four decades of writing and teaching. He is the author of several books, numerous magazine articles, several plays, and has also worked as a broadcaster and producer at CBC Radio. He has been teaching writing – currently third- and fourth-year courses in the Professional Writing Program – at York University since 2006. His most recent book,&nbsp;<a href="https://yfile.news.yorku.ca/2022/10/05/veteran-adjunct-professor-writer-interviewing-trainer-publishes-new-book/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published in 2022</a>, was an extension of his teaching called&nbsp;<em>Asking the Best Questions:</em>&nbsp;<em>A comprehensive interviewing handbook for journalists, podcasters, bloggers, vloggers, influencers, and anyone who asks questions</em>&nbsp;<em>under pressure</em>.</p>

<p>Department of Sociology will host a discussion on Nov. 16 that delves into Canada’s strategy for promoting social inclusion among Indigenous and vulnerable communities, and how it could inform Greek policymakers. The talk, titled “Social Exclusion of Roma, Indigenous People and Irregular Migrants,” aims to offer valuable insights for Greek policymakers seeking to tackle the issues confronting marginalized groups, including the Roma community, migrants and undocumented individuals.</p>



<p>The talk emphasizes the crucial endeavour of aligning equitable ideals with the current social landscape.</p>



<p>Participants will learn from guest speaker&nbsp;<strong>Andriani Papadopoulou</strong>, a senior investigator in the human rights and equal treatment departments of the Greek Ombudsman. Papadopoulou earned her PhD in sociology from York University in 1994, and her work revolves<br>around combatting discrimination and examining the ways though which socially vulnerable groups sustain and reinvent their heritage in their new-found societies.</p>



<p>The event’s discussant,&nbsp;<strong>Gemechu Abeshu</strong>, is a postdoctoral Fellow in York’s Department of Sociology and his research interests include forced displacements, racialized refugee integration and non-state political power forms. Abeshu has a PhD in social anthropology from Bayreuth University, Germany.</p>



<p>The event is co-sponsored by York’s Department of Sociology (Faculty of Liberal Arts &amp; Professional Studies), the Department of Sociology Maurice Manel Colloquium Fund, York’s Resource Centre for Public Sociology, York’s Centre for Refugee Studies and the York Research Chair in Political Sociology of Health (<strong>Cary Wu</strong>).</p>



<p>It takes place in S802 Ross Building on the Keele Campus from 2:30 to 4 p.m. and is a hybrid event. RSPV by Nov. 9 using <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/0jTY3hFpLE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the registration form</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://vista.info.yorku.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VISTA</a>: Vision Science to Applications, York University’s first large-scale research program to receive support from the Canada First Research Excellence Fund (CFREF), will enter a new phase in 2024 after marking its seven-year milestone.</p>



<p>The novel program was first awarded $33.4 million from CFREF, the country’s top federal research grant, back in 2016. Since then, the VISTA program has established itself as an international leader in vision research across a wide range of real-world applications – from basic visual function to 3D imaging to computer vision and object recognition – and played a significant role in growing York University’s standout reputation in the field of vision science.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>“VISTA has been a labour of love and it’s taken vision research at York to the next level,” said Doug Crawford, the program’s inaugural scientific director, who now heads up York’s second CFREF program, <a href="https://yfile.news.yorku.ca/2023/04/28/york-led-318m-project-to-create-transformational-change-in-inclusive-tech-research/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Connected Minds</a>. “I believe that over these last seven years, VISTA has become the best vision research program in the world.”  </p>



<p>With over 500 international co-authored publications, over 100 research awards, dozens of patent filings and invention disclosures, several startups, among other achievements, the VISTA program has experienced great success.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>VISTA funded 18 new faculty hires and 148 postgraduate trainees, working across five Faculties, including the Lassonde School of Engineering, the Faculty of Health, the Faculty of Science, the School of the Arts, Media, Performance &amp; Design, and the Faculty of Liberal Arts &amp; Professional Studies. </p>



<p>The program’s partnership and affiliate programs resulted in more than 300 external collaborations across multiple sectors, leading to new applications in law enforcement, clinical diagnosis, art exhibits and space research.  </p>

<p>Altogether, the program’s distinguished membership, including 16 Canada Research Chairs, brought in more than $89 million of external research income, including research grants and partner contributions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that the CFREF grant is coming to the end of its seven-year term, VISTA will continue to operate as part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.yorku.ca/cvr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Centre for Vision Research</a>&nbsp;(CVR) at York, where an interdisciplinary team gathers to advance fundamental research that merges techniques in human psychophysics, visual neuroscience, computer vision and computational theory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to the historic CFREF grant, contributions from the University and other external partners, the VISTA program received more than $120 million in total funding over its first seven years. </p>



<p>“VISTA forged strong and sustained links between vision science at York and industry partners, nationally and internationally,” said Laurie Wilcox, an esteemed vision researcher and VISTA’s new scientific director. “The program has fostered close collaborations, invested in state-of-the-art equipment and laid the foundation for a continued focus on applied vision with the Centre for Vision Research. I am excited to work with the CVR to establish this new phase of the VISTA program.”</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>To mark the program’s milestone seventh year and its transition, the Office of the Vice-President Research &amp; Innovation hosted a celebration event earlier this month.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“With many of the world’s top experts conducting cutting-edge research and innovation, training highly qualified personnel, and offering academic programs in the field of biological and computer vision right here at York, the VISTA program is a crowning achievement of their research excellence, and an incredible source of pride for the entire University community,” said Amir Asif, vice-president research and innovation, speaking at the event.</p>

<p id="_iaF3tljobIm19R">Professor MacKinnon&nbsp;shares&nbsp;that&nbsp;the&nbsp;“process of developing content for this website was&nbsp;explorative,&nbsp;multi-staged, and involved significant stakeholder engagement.”&nbsp;It began with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8Oja17QuI">Detransition Symposium</a>&nbsp;and community event held in November 2022 at York University.&nbsp;At this symposium, results from the two research studies were presented and discussed with stakeholders such as detrans, nonbinary, trans, and queer people, their friends and families, gender care providers, and 2SLGBTQ+ program developers and educators.”&nbsp;The content for the website was iteratively produced by analyzing feedback and discussion notes collected at the symposium, through conversations had with&nbsp;an&nbsp;advisory committee, and by soliciting&nbsp;feedback from several detransitioners, and a&nbsp;parent.</p>



<p id="_GrQijIrdBQy8CH">Furthermore,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/381/bmj-2022-073584">in an article for The&nbsp;BMJ,</a>&nbsp;Professor MacKinnon&nbsp;and colleagues discuss how research and care services have overlooked people who detransition—those who discontinue&nbsp;or reverse gender care treatment, and how unmet physical and mental healthcare needs&nbsp;and stigma&nbsp;are commonly reported among&nbsp;this&nbsp;population. Professor MacKinnon also identifies&nbsp;how short-term&nbsp;studies into transitioning may have unintentionally excluded and erased detransition&nbsp;and identity shifts. Ultimately, Professor MacKinnon&nbsp;discusses&nbsp;how robust research is needed to inform the development of comprehensive&nbsp;knowledge, practice guidelines, and care services inclusive of&nbsp;detransition/retransition and gender-diverse identity evolution.</p>

<p id="_nbcA9Bvq2MyIjK">In the podcast, Dr. Chrostowska starts with the genesis of the book and discusses the way the term utopia is used today, and some of the reasons for its rehabilitation as a concept at a time when reality increasingly resembles dystopia.&nbsp;Dr. Chrostowska&nbsp;examines the tension between utopian thinking and life as survival and develops the idea that utopian dreaming as well as utopianizing democratic practices and politics can spring from our growing consciousness that humanity worldwide is being “reduced” to the condition of survival.&nbsp;Dr. Chrostowska&nbsp;provides an overview of key ideas in the book, namely, utopia as&nbsp;<em>myth</em>&nbsp;and as&nbsp;<em>hypothesis</em>, and utopianism as a&nbsp;<em>plural</em>&nbsp;and inherently&nbsp;<em>iconoclastic</em>&nbsp;intellectual and literary tradition. Rejecting the view that utopianism in these senses is out of touch or antithetical to contemporary left-wing politics, Dr. Chrostowska argues that it is the only way to address and survive our current crises. Utopia may be the most appropriate and effective survival skill for humankind and the planet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Three LA&amp;PS researchers are among the latest recipients of Connection Grants from the Social Sciences &amp; Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC). Richard Saunders, Johanne Jean-Pierre and Yvonne Su from the Faculty of Liberal Arts &amp; Professional Studies, were awarded the funding for various knowledge mobilization activities related to their different research projects. </p>



<p>The grants fund activities like research events, workshops and community outreach, and are intended to spark new connections between academic and non-academic partners, and collaboration between the public, private and not-for-profit sectors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Saunders’ project, “Resource Nationalism and African Mining Policy Innovation: Mobilizing New Research and Engaging Key Stakeholders,” received $49,991. Saunders and his team will organize several outreach activities, including policy workshops on mining reform in Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe, an international research conference at York, and a policy seminar in Ottawa for government officials, African diplomats and non-governmental organizations. Saunders, along with undergraduate and graduate students, will also produce policy briefs on mining sector reforms for distribution across multiple African and Canadian platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jean-Pierre’s project, “Symposium: Designing a flourishing future and researching with Black communities in Canada,” received $13,934. The grant supports a conference to be held at York on Nov. 20, bringing together French- and English-speaking Black interdisciplinary scholars to discuss how to conduct research with Black Canadian communities ethically and effectively. Findings from the conference will be shared in a research brief and two open-access, peer-reviewed articles to improve research methods for social scientists and health scholars who engage with Black and other historically excluded populations. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Su’s project<em>, “</em>Stories of Change: Listening to Global South Perspectives on Climate-Induced Migration,” received $49,945. The SSHRC funding will support a 10-episode educational podcast that will highlight Su and her colleagues’ research, while also focusing on the voices and stories of marginalized people and groups most impacted by climate change – displaced people and migrants, Indigenous communities and grassroots organizations in the Global South. Launch events for the podcast will also be held in Toronto, Nairobi and Berlin.  </p>



<p>The three researchers from LA&amp;PS and one from the Faculty of Education at York were among the 64 awardees across the country to receive the latest round of Connection Grants from the SSHRC totalling $1,910,441.  </p>

<p>On digital apps and platforms, sexy snapshots abound. But well before the advent of smartphones with cameras, a midcentury media technology reduced barriers to entry for anyone wishing to dabble in intimate photography: the Polaroid camera. Polaroid invited new possibilities for documenting taboo sexuality, explicit and otherwise. This distinctly queer dimension of instant photography is missing from popular history. Rather, accounts of Polaroid often celebrate a 1965 model, dubbed “the swinger,” for bolstering American sexual liberation writ large. This presentation reveals two ironies at the heart of that narrative. First, by invoking in a mass media campaign a term with titillating connotations for some, Polaroid expanded the categories of erotic encounters that “swinger” signalled, while also muting the force of its deviance. Second, if there is a story about Polaroid cameras and sexual liberation, that story begins with gays and lesbians.</p>

<p>The five lecturers, and their manifesto titles, are:</p>



<h4>Joseph M. Pierce, “A Manifesto for Speculative Relations”</h4>



<p>A Cherokee Nation citizen, Pierce is an associate professor at Stony Brook University, author of&nbsp;<em>Argentine Intimacies: Queer Kinship in an Age of Splendor, 1890-1910</em>&nbsp;(SUNY Press, 2019) and co-editor of&nbsp;<em>Políticas del amor: Derechos sexuales y escrituras disidentes en el Cono Sur</em>&nbsp;(Cuarto Propio, 2018).</p>



<p>His Alchemy Lecture will propose a method of restoring Indigenous forms of relation in pursuit of a possible future in which life (all life) becomes possible, in spite of the ongoing brutality of colonial infrastructure, economic extraction and historical erasure. Pierce aims for the lecture to be a prayer offered with humility and gratitude to the ancestral relations that open up speculative possibilities for bodies reverberating in good relation. It is a manifesto for landing, grounding and relating; for opening the body, in all its forms and transitions, towards an imperative mutuality.</p>



<h4>Phoebe Boswell, “Manifesto of the As Yet Unlived Thing”</h4>



<p>From Kenya and the United Kingdom, Boswell is an artist whose work is anchored to what she describes as a “a restless state of diasporic consciousness.”</p>



<p>Centred around drawing – but encompassing moving image, animation, painting, photography, sound, writing and immersive site-sensitive installation – her work explores notions of freedom, protest, grief, intimacy, migration, love, the body and its world-making, using auto/biographical stories as catalysts to contest histories and imagine futures.</p>



<p>Her manifesto will recount her experience in 2020 receiving an invitation to be the first artist-in-residence of a virtual museum&nbsp;being imagined, designed and built amidst the anxious haze of a global pandemic. It will recount the experience of considering how to make and create an imagined space where logistical restrictions would not matter and explore questions like, “What could be made in this space&nbsp;and in this moment,&nbsp;sitting&nbsp;at&nbsp;home alone,&nbsp;world outside&nbsp;collapsing,&nbsp;and our reliance on&nbsp;technology&nbsp;edging us towards&nbsp;relation to&nbsp;the virtual&nbsp;as a&nbsp;tangible,&nbsp;lived and intimate&nbsp;thing?&nbsp;What could be dreamt there? What could be realized? Where could we go and what could we do?”</p>



<p><strong>Cristina Rivera Garza, “Subjunctive: A Manifesto about Language, Territory, and the Yet to Come”</strong></p>



<p>From Mexico and the United States,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Rivera Garza is an award-winning author of six novels, four collections of short stories, five collections of poetry and four non-fiction books. She is a Distinguished Professor in Hispanic Studies and director of the PhD program in creative writing in Spanish at the University of Houston. Rivera Garza is the recipient of a 2020 MacArthur Fellowship and a finalist for the 2020 National Book Critic’s Circle Award for Criticism.</p>



<p>Rivera Garza’s manifesto will explore the subjunctive, a grammatical tool that allows for the expression of the hypothetical, and how it can question the relationship between territory, human and non-human beings, and the worlds to come. She will discuss how, widely used in the Spanish-speaking world, the subjunctive breaks from the tyranny of the future and its many apocalyptic dead-ends by harnessing the potency of imaginings and desires half-disclosed to affect the yet to come.</p>



<h4>Saidiya Hartman, “Crow Jane Makes a Modest Proposal to Improve Race Relations”</h4>



<p>From the U.S., Saidiya Hartman is the author of <em>Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments: Intimate Histories of Social Upheaval</em>,&nbsp;<em>Lose Your Mother: A Journey Along the Atlantic Slave Route</em>&nbsp;and <em>Scenes of Subjection: Terror, Slavery, and Self-Making in Nineteenth-Century America</em>. A MacArthur Genius Fellow, she has been a Guggenheim Fellow, Cullman Fellow and Fulbright Scholar. She is a University Professor at Columbia University, in the Department of English &amp; Comparative Literature. In addition to her books, she has published articles in journals such as <em>South Atlantic Quarterly</em>, <em>Brick</em>, <em>Small Axe</em>, <em>Callaloo</em>, <em>The New Yorker</em>&nbsp;and <em>The Paris Review</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her manifesto will be what he describes as a rant in prose, a “wild impassioned shout, unwise remarks and untimely suggestions about exacerbating the current crisis and cultivating recalcitrance. It is a fabulation, a tirade about the ruins of political speech and the exhaustion of standard and habitual methods of approaching the problem.”</p>



<h4>Janaína Oliveira, “Manifesto for Curation”</h4>



<p>From Brazil, Janaína Oliveira&nbsp;is a film scholar and independent curator and professor at the Federal Institute of Rio de Janeiro and consultant for JustFilms/Ford Foundation. Oliveira has a PhD in history and was a Fulbright Visiting Scholar at the Center for African Studies at Howard University, and has focused on Black and African cinemas. She has also worked as a consultant, juror and panellist in several film festivals and institutions in Brazil and abroad.</p>



<p>She is the founder of the Black Cinema Itinerant Forum and was the Flaherty Film Seminar (New York) programmer in 2021 and for the Zózimo Bulbul Black Film Festival (Rio de Janeiro) from 2017 to 2021. Besides participating in other curatorial initiatives, she is part of the BlackStar Film Festival curatorial team as the documentary feature film section Chair and board of the William Greaves Fund from Firelight Media.</p>



<p>Her talk will consider film curatorship and its link to care, notably not only what is shown but the many layers of care involved in how it is shown and in the relationship with whom one wants to show it. It points, therefore, to the urgency of broadening the understanding and reflections of what is the film curator’s work and the possibilities of transforming the world with moving images.</p>



<p>The event will have a reception from 6 to 7 p.m., followed by the lecture, which runs from 7 to 9 p.m. at the Sandra Faire &amp; Ivan Fecan Theatre in the CIBC Lobby.</p>



<p>This lecture, like last year’s, will culminate in the publication of a book bearing the title of <em>Five Manifestos for the Beautiful World</em> in the imprint, Alchemy by Knopf.</p>
