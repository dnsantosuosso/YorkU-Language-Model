<p>Rebecca Irwin is York University’s first associate director research security, effective October 10.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prior to joining York, Irwin worked for the Government of Canada, both in Ottawa and Toronto, on national security priorities. In her 16 years with the federal government, she managed teams and projects in the national security space and has experience on issues impacting research security.</p>



<p>“Ms. Irwin has the vital skills and experience to safeguard York University’s growing research and innovation enterprise and serve as its key liaison to government and agency officials on risk management and compliance,” said Jennifer MacLean, assistant vice-president innovation and research partnerships. “Her direction on security issues will ensure York researchers are well-protected in their international collaborations and are well-equipped to fulfill all government funding requirements.”</p>



<p>In her new role in the Office of the Vice-President Research &amp; Innovation (VPRI), Irwin will lead the development and implementation of the University’s research security strategy related to funding, partnerships, commercialization, data governance, cybersecurity and associated policies, procedures and programs.</p>



<p>She will advise York faculty on security best practices, oversee the review of select research agreements and support the research community with adherence to rules and regulations related to the legal protection of intellectual property and export control.</p>



<p>“I am delighted to join York University and support its community of changemakers navigate the evolving landscape of research security protocols,” said Irwin, who holds a master’s degree in international relations from the University of Warwick and a bachelor’s degree in history from Western University. “I welcome the opportunity to champion the University’s interests in global research partnerships, strengthen institutional safety and security, and empower York’s innovative researchers to excel in their work.”</p>



<p>Recently, in the face of new geopolitical realities, safeguarding the international research activities of Canadian universities has become more and more of a government priority, at both the federal and provincial level. Research-intensive universities across the country are in consultation with government funding agencies, Public Safety Canada, and groups like the Ontario Council of Ontario Research (OCUR) to establish greater alignment and coordination on new and emerging security guidelines.</p>



<p>“York University is dedicated to ensuring the safety and security of its researchers and their research partnerships. As an institution, we are known for our global engagement and our collaborative approach, which makes safeguarding research even more of a top priority for York,” said Amir Asif, vice-president research &amp; innovation. “I am pleased to welcome Ms. Irwin to her new role as VPRI is committed to streamlining the funding process for our researchers and facilitating the ease of collaborations as much as possible. Our support enables our researchers to focus on what they do best: conduct purposeful research that advances knowledge and creates positive change.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>The appointment of an associate director research security is part of the University’s ongoing efforts to meet new government funding requirements and enhance the security of York research.</p>



<p>Researchers with a security question or concern can contact Rebecca Irwin at <a href="mailto:researchsecurity@yorku.ca">researchsecurity@yorku.ca</a> </p>

<p>This interview was conducted by Research Apprenticeship Programme (RAP) student Alyssa Ramos, Glendon Campus, with Professor Sheila Colla, Faculty of the Environment and Urban Change (<a href="https://www.savethebumblebees.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.savethebumblebees.ca</a>).</p>



<p><strong><em>How did you end up in this field, studying bees and their relationship to the environment and climate change?</em>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>During my undergraduate degree, the University of Toronto had the option to get course credit by volunteering in a lab. I was placed in a lab that studied evolutionary ecology of bees and plants, where I overcame my fear of them. Through working in that lab, I realized that no one was studying the decline of native bumblebees in Ontario despite evidence that some had declined rapidly so I decided to work on that for my PhD at York University.</p>



<p><em><strong>Most of us understand the idea of greenwashing, when corporations spend money on campaigns to "look green" while carrying out unsustainable practices. But the idea of "beewashing" is new to me. Can you explain what this means?&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p>Beewashing refers to branding of actions as sustainable and/or helpful for declining bees when in fact they are not. The biggest example is the promotion of honeybees outside of their native areas as somehow good for the environment or bee populations.&nbsp; In North America, we have about 2000 native bee species, none of which are the European Honeybee.&nbsp; Our native bees overwinter by sleeping and thus do not collect honey (aside from species in Mexico) and they are mostly solitary (not living in hives). Most of our native bee species have not been assessed in terms of conservation status but for those that have been, diseases introduced from managed bees seem to be a key threat. There is also growing evidence that honeybees can disrupt pollination of native plants and can outcompete native bees for pollen and nectar. The European Honeybee is not at risk of extinction and is in fact one of the most common livestock animals and invasive bees around the world. The fact that many businesses are adding honeybee hives and calling it a sustainability initiative, while actually increasing pressures to wild bees is the epitome of beewashing.&nbsp; We would never through a million Asian Carp into the great lakes and say we are saving declining fishes, so why do we accept it with bees?&nbsp;</p>



<p><em><strong>What is the relationship between bees and climate change? How does your work championing wild bees compared to "managed bees" -- managed by humans, for instance, for honey production -- relate to climate change?</strong></em></p>



<p>Honeybees are livestock. They produce honey, which is a food item that we use. But it's not related to climate change.&nbsp;In order to address climate change we need to conserve a diverse and abundant wild bee community. When we have a lot of species doing pollination services, our food systems and natural ecosystems will be more resilient to climate change. If we reduce diversity and put all our eggs in one basket, all it takes is one disease or weather event to come through to knock out that species and we are in big trouble.&nbsp; We saw how risky this is with how quickly Varroa mites and colony collapse disorder swept through honeybee colonies. It's also important to note that climate change is a threat to wild bees, native plants and other wildlife species, so prioritizing mitigating climate change is critical in order to conserve native pollinators and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>Written by Liliana Antonshyn and Alyssa Ramos, Research Apprenticeship Programme students at Glendon College, York University</em></p>



<p>On March 29th, the Dahdaleh Institute for Global Health Research held a collective discussion, led by <strong><a href="https://www.yorku.ca/dighr/person/carol-devine/">Carol Devine</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.yorku.ca/dighr/person/yasmin-al-sahili/">Yasmin Al-Sahili</a></strong>. Devine is a Community Scholar at the Dahdaleh Institute working on a framework for Planetary Health Advocacy. Al-Sahili worked on the Planetary Health Advocacy Framework, as a research assistant, with Devine.</p>



<p>The question that animated the group is: how do we build strategies to frame and communicate knowledge about planetary health? The aim is to develop principles that further advocacy in the areas of humanitarianism, global health, planetary health, and climate change.</p>



<p>What began as a framework has evolved, Devine and Al-Sahili emphasize, more into a "tool for advocacy" that explores the impacts of climate change on health. The tool is meant to inform operational programs to mitigate climate change and advocacy for new ways of living that are sustainable for humans and for other life on earth.</p>



<p>As a living tool, it is constantly and sometimes rapidly changing in response to dialogue from a wide range of actors. This dialogue is vital. As Devine paraphrases Indigenous Planetary Health leader Dr. Nicole Redvers, climate change will not be resolved by technical fixes. Instead, “what will solve the climate crisis is language and dialogue”.</p>



<p>While developing the tool, a major question is figuring out how to effectively communicate knowledge to diverse audiences. A circular design with multiple rings, for instance, seeks to show the interconnectivity of different elements. This recalls the relationships between human health and the wellbeing of the natural world, as well as known solutions among and across different actors.</p>



<p>Indigenous peoples and local communities are especially important, Devine emphasized, to biodiversity stewardship and knowing climate change solutions.</p>



<p>Al-Sahili echoes this view. She emphasizes the importance of understanding colonialism and colonial practices in exacerbating climate change-associated health consequences. Those who have been subject to colonialism suffer the most immediate effects of climate change," Al-Sahili observes," but they have contributed the least to global warming. The voices of those with non-western worldviews, and specifically Indigenous knowledges, perspectives, and ways of doing, are critical to decolonizing planetary health tools."</p>



<p>This means recognizing that we live in a pluralistic world, where many different ways of knowing co-exist.</p>



<p>Many Western-trained scientists understand the world in terms of systems and variables. This may be very different from how other communities and cultures make sense of themselves and their environments. Despite the diversity across and within their communities, many Indigenous peoples, for instance, understand the world as embedded in strong, even sacred responsibilities to the lands that have been theirs from time immemorial. Indigenous scientists may bring their Indigenous knowledges to problem-solving as they seek to understand and mitigate climate change.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>



<p>The framework must respond to competing paradigms. As a living tool, it always has room for change, updates and improvements.</p>



<p>Participants at the seminar had many ideas they contributed to the conversation.</p>



<p>Some suggested that it would be useful to add stories to the tool to illustrate and communicate knowledge to broad audiences. Stories represent us and are central to who we are as human beings. As Professor Orbinski observed, “While we have a lot of science about climate change, we don't have many stories”.</p>



<p>Compelling narratives, as much as or in combination with science, are necessary to help us to understand the challenges that climate change represents.</p>



<p>Others proposed developing a certificate program within the Institute for Global Health Research to share knowledge within academia about the critical importance of planetary health.</p>



<p>In addition, the tool for planetary health needs to be relevant beyond academia. To be meaningful, participants emphasized, the tool has to be understandable for many people. Some participants suggested building a website to make the tool interactive, dynamic and accessible to a wide range of users.</p>



<p>Out of the lively discussion, the relationship between global health and well-being and planetary health was emphasized again and again. We will only become healthy, as communities, when we live in healthy ecologies. That demands that we do what we can to mitigate climate change and prevent more negative impacts, suffering and loss, while simultaneously advocating to secure more ecologically sustainable and equitable futures.</p>

<p><em>Written by Elaine Coburn, Director of the Centre for Feminist Research (CFR). The CFR held this panel on March 30.</em></p>



<p>"Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred. Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people. Vulnerable communities who have historically contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected.”</p>



<p>This is one of the sober assessments in the 2023 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change synthesis report. How can we grapple with these changes in climate, and the consequences for nature and for people, especially the most vulnerable among us?</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yorku.ca/research/wp-content/uploads/sites/39/2023/03/Photo-McKinnon-shorebird-chicks-1-edited.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-29093" width="270" height="180" srcset="https://www.yorku.ca/research/wp-content/uploads/sites/39/2023/03/Photo-McKinnon-shorebird-chicks-1-edited.jpg 1080w, https://www.yorku.ca/research/wp-content/uploads/sites/39/2023/03/Photo-McKinnon-shorebird-chicks-1-edited-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.yorku.ca/research/wp-content/uploads/sites/39/2023/03/Photo-McKinnon-shorebird-chicks-1-edited-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.yorku.ca/research/wp-content/uploads/sites/39/2023/03/Photo-McKinnon-shorebird-chicks-1-edited-391x260.jpg 391w" sizes="(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px" /><figcaption>Shorebird chicks (Photo credit: Laura McKinnon)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As an ecologist who is interested in the effects of climate change on migratory birds, Dr. <strong><a href="https://www.glendon.yorku.ca/mckinnonlab/">Laura McKinnon</a></strong>’s research aims to document how the warming of the Arctic and sub-Artic regions are affecting arctic birds. Effects of climate change are not always easy to detect. Though global warming may result in changes in availability of food sources for birds, Dr. McKinnon explained, the warmer weather could also reduce energy requirements. Not only are birds facing potential changes in resources, they are also facing potential changes in predation pressure as some predators, such as the red fox, expand their range further north. Researchers can collect data to provide insight into how bird species may cope with these changes, but “If we want to challenge climate change and protect migrant bird populations,” Dr. McKinnon emphasized, “it will take more than scientists studying what is happening to them. We need collective conservation efforts that tackle the social, political and environmental aspects of climate change.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Dr. <strong><a href="https://www.yorku.ca/dighr/person/byomkesh-talukder/">Byomkesh Talukder</a></strong>, climate change has effects that can be measured in changes to nature and to human communities, where his own research in Bangladesh, shows the wide-ranging consequences of rising oceans and the salination of fresh water rivers. Fresh water fish, once important to local diets, do not survive in the salinated water. High blood pressure in adult men and women, as well as miscarriages in women, are some of the more immediate health consequences. But communities are affected in other ways. “In particular, women are suffering from miscarriages” Dr. Talukder notes, “and their mental health is also suffering, since they now must travel and wait long hours for access to fresh water, which we all need to survive.” Grappling with climate change means taking up these complexities, which affect both local ecological systems and the human communities that depend on them for survival.</p>



<p>In her work on the <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Routledge-Handbook-on-the-Green-New-Deal/Tienhaara-Robinson/p/book/9780367628048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Green New Deal</a>, sociologist Dr. <strong><a href="https://www.glendon.yorku.ca/about/spotlight-sociology-joanna-robinson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joanna Robinson</a></strong> emphasizes that taking up the challenges of climate change is necessary for life to continue: the stakes cannot be overstated for human beings and for many other forms of life. There are solutions, however, especially as the consensus shifts to recognize the urgency of climate change. “We can support a shift to a greener economy, not just through new technologies” Dr. Robinson argues, “but by expanding those parts of the economy that have always been green, like the caring and service professions.” Best practices from around the world can be taken up anywhere, for instance, through policies that centre measures of well-being as central to political decision-making, as in Aotearoa/New Zealand, rather than a narrow focus on economic growth. At its best, climate change movements can bring about transformations that will enable a livable planet, but also a more equitable one. “In places like Canada, Indigenous knowledges are a critical to challenging climate change” Dr. Robinson emphasized, “and to creating more just relationships.”</p>



<p>Filmmaker Shabnam Sukhdev presented a short clip from her film, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsXA8-QvzIE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Earth Crusader</a>, </em>which invites us to listen to the late Didi Contractor. A German American urban designer who lived most of her life in India, Contractor lived her ecological commitments in the buildings that she created and in her own home. Contractor is blunt in her assessment of the challenges of living ecologically, “It’s very difficult to walk your talk, because it’s set up against you.” Nonetheless, sustainable ways of living are worth striving for, she emphasized, in work and in life. Contractor created beautiful, functional and ecological buildings and lived her own life without waste, to be respectful to the planet and to future generations. “A place in heaven, for me, is the here and now” Contractor added, “And it is in doing small things carefully that we learn to do large things”. For Sukhdev, Contractor is a vital reminder that we have choices and that we can choose to live, not just for immediate needs and wants, but in ways that are responsible to life now and in the years to come. As Contractor observed about Mahatma Gandhi: “He made his decision keeping in mind the weakest members of society, and to me, the weakest members are those who are yet unborn.”</p>



<p>As the latest IPCC report reminds us, climate change is already with us and creating serious harms to nature and to people. Given the crisis we face, all four of the speakers emphasized the importance of acting where you are and with what you know. We can do this through the sciences, the social sciences and the arts, and by listening to and working across disciplines and knowledge traditions. Given the complexities of climate change, all the different ways we understand the world must be mobilized, not for knowledges sake but to galvanize meaningful action now.</p>

<p><em>Written by Tesni Ellis, PhD Student in Education</em></p>



<p>During Climate Change Research Month, at the March 16 lecture hosted by the York University’s Emergency Mitigation, Engagement, Response and Governance Institute (Y-EMERGE), listeners were invited to draw our attention inwards to proactively consider the “fire and floods” in our own backyard.</p>



<p>Dr. <strong><a href="https://profiles.laps.yorku.ca/profiles/yvonnesu/">Yvonne Su</a></strong> began her talk by sharing a selection of photographs of devastating wildfires, from Australia to Greece to California to Lytton, British Columbia. With their vivid oranges and reds and their smoke-filled skylines, the scorching images reminded us, in Dr. Su’s words, that “climate change fuels the fires, and the fires fuel climate change.”</p>



<p>Climate change is predicted to increase the frequency and intensity of natural disasters worldwide, Dr. Su explained. Several threats to Canada were recently outlined in a climate change report by the<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/csis-climate-change-threats-canada-1.6768803"> </a><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/csis-climate-change-threats-canada-1.6768803">Canadian Security Intelligence Services (CSIS)’ outlines threats</a> to Canadians, including water and food security, Arctic sovereignty, and coastal security.</p>



<p>A proactive turn inwards, Dr. Su observed, is essential for generating community-based plans and solutions, in the face of climate disaster locally as well as globally.</p>



<p>But this requires us to challenge common myths, Dr. Su underlined, especially the alarmist narrative dominating news today – the idea that the Global North needs to prepare for mass numbers of climate refugees and migrants coming from the Global South. Informed by a colonial mindset, such fear-mongering feeds into unfounded ideas that displaced peoples will move across continents as they flee climate change.</p>



<p>The research tells a different story, Dr. Su explained, one that is closer to home. Most displaced peoples seek to return to their homes and rebuild, so migration due to climate change is local and regional, not international. Further, we can learn from community-based solutions enacted worldwide when developing our own preparedness plans.</p>



<p>In a context where climate change is happening in our own country, Dr. Su observed, we must focus on proactive, practical solutions. These solutions will centre:</p>



<p>·&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; community-based, planned relocation;</p>



<p>·&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; multi-year and multi-hazard prevention plans;</p>



<p>·&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cooperative, multi-level governance and resources;</p>



<p>·&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and preparation and support for host communities.</p>



<p>We need to ask ourselves hard questions, Dr. Su suggests, and consider internal migration “so we can be sensitive to the tensions that might rise up, and be proactive for what may come, so we can be prepared.” Questions like<em>,</em> “If a disaster was to strike Toronto, for instance, where would we go?”</p>



<p>“How many of us are having these conversations?” Dr. Su urged. We need to “start with ourselves and then expand beyond our own household with empathy towards those who may be displaced now or in the future.”</p>



<p>All of this demands a politics of preparedness, engagement, and listening to communities. It means, too, that we must take politics seriously. Dr. Su explains:</p>



<p>“There is a need for us to push our politicians to think proactively, to show them that we care and that climate change is a priority for us. We need to make it clear that Canadians care about living in a good environment and that we care about living in a nation that is free of significant natural hazards due to climate change.”</p>



<p>When election time comes around, we must advocate for policies that address the serious challenge climate change represents, for all who live in Canada and beyond, beginning in our own backyards.</p>

<p><em>Written by Evangeline Kroon</em></p>



<p><em>Organized by the Robarts Centre for Canadian Studies on March 7, 2023.</em></p>



<p>Is caring about climate change enough to make political change?</p>



<p>My research takes up this question by looking at Guelph, Ontario where, in 2018, the riding elected Green Party candidate Mike Schreiner. The Green Party’s success was significant, since this election marked the first time a Green Party candidate was ever elected in Ontario.</p>



<p>Was this a turning point for Canada?</p>



<p>Thinking back to 2018, it felt like a watershed moment for the environment. There were Climate marches worldwide. Fridays for Future saw students walking out of classrooms on a weekly basis to protect inaction about climate change. Trudeau banned plastic straws, as a small step to curbing plastics pollution.</p>



<p>Was the election of Ontario first-ever Green Party MPP in Guelph the beginning of a political movement that was going to spread across the country? And if so, why there, and why then?</p>



<p>To answer this question, I traced the history of Green parties in parliamentary systems, in Europe and Australasia, that are similar to Canada. Since Green parties have existed and been successful since the early 1970s, there was much to be learned from experiences elsewhere. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I found a range of factors mattered for Green parties’ election success, including a strong economy, guaranteed government funding for registered political parties, and competition among political parties for Green Party votes.</p>



<p>But what about the Green Party in Ontario?</p>



<p>Ontario has a unique history, rooted in an economy built on extraction and manufacturing but now more dependent on finance and services. It is a very wealthy province, and a politically powerful one. &nbsp;Ontario has high levels of education, compared to other provinces. From 1985 to today, Ontario has had a &nbsp;competitive three-party system, where the Conservative, Liberal, and New Democratic parties have each formed majority governments.</p>



<p>Together, these factors are hopeful for those who support Green parties, since the province does not depend on the fossil fuel industry, it has a strong economy, a highly educated population and a competitive party system.</p>



<p>Gains are possible, especially in cities like Guelph, which boasts a relatively wealthy, highly educated citizenry, motivated to address climate change. Since Ontario is a powerful province, the election of a Green official in Ontario could signal a shift in broader political norms across the country.</p>



<p>But many questions remain.</p>



<p>How do Green parties strategize in Ontario’s first part the post voting system? What happens if current economic uncertainties worsen and deepen? How do voting districts that favour the suburban and rural vote play into Green party success across Ontario?</p>



<p>One thing is certain.</p>



<p>Caring about climate change and Green politics is not enough to ensure a Green Party win. But making climate change a major electoral issue is necessary, if there is to be any chance at all.</p>

<p><em>Written by Nathi Zamisa, MA student in Social and Political Thought</em></p>



<p>For the last decade, the Executive Director of the Cornell Industrial and Labour Relations School’s Climate Jobs Institute, Dr. Lara Skinner, has been working to launch union-led climate jobs coalitions. Together with labour unions, elected leaders, environmental groups, and industry experts, she has worked in states like Texas, Illinois, New York, and Rhode Island to transform the way labour engages with equity and climate justice.</p>



<p>Her presentation at the <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/research/glrc/">Global Labour Research Centre</a>’s <em>2023 John Eleen Annual Lecture in Global Labour</em>, “Labour and the Climate Crisis: Developing a Worker- and Equity-Centred Clean Energy Economy,” taught us how union-led coalitions contribute to climate justice.</p>



<p>The United States’ (U.S.) <a href="https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/inflation-reduction-act"><em>Inflation Reduction Act</em></a><a href="https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/inflation-reduction-act">, 2022</a> calls for an injection of $370 billion to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency calls this the “most significant climate legislation in U.S. history.” This is an opportunity to create scalable projects that create well-paying and unionized climate jobs, &nbsp;for racialized and frontline communities impacted by climate change and historical inequities. But the move from policy to practice, or in Dr. Skinner's words, the move “from ambition to action,” requires a massive update of American infrastructure and of the US economy.</p>



<p>“Let’s talk about why this is a challenge,” proposes Dr. Skinner. First, unionization rates in fossil fuels industries are twice as high as those in renewables energies. Second, green energy jobs are not paying well when compared to similar jobs in fossil fuels industries. Third, frontline communities hit hard by climate change and historically marginalized communities face significant barriers to accessing clean energy jobs.</p>



<p>In meeting the challenge, Dr. Skinner’s New York Climate Jobs Program developed climate, energy, and labour market analyses for cities and states. The aim was to identify challenges and opportunities for a green energy jobs transition. Quickly, the Program moved from research to policy advocacy and to training, and education on how to maximize emissions reductions and create new union jobs. The program’s ‘labour-only’ grounded approach relied on “building trades and energy unions working in these coalitions.” This is because, Dr. Skinner explains, “unions already have tremendous experience and expertise in making this transition”.</p>



<p>The result? Think equity-based, well-paying green jobs led by unions, Dr. Skinner suggests, working to develop science-based solutions to climate change and designed to help labour and climate movements navigate the transition to a clean energy economy.</p>



<p>The Program’s success laid a foundation for the Climate Jobs National Research Centre. The Centre focusses on forward-looking proposals to identify what needs to be built to realize a green energy transition, all while working to ensure the active participation of unions, equity-deserving groups, and frontline community members in developing a plan. From there, Dr. Skinner says that “unions formed their own coalition, Climate Jobs New York, and they ran a campaign promoting offshore wind” using the Climate Jobs Institute’s proposal. In response, New York committed to securing 50% of its power from offshore wind, and to setting wage requirements for wind and solar projects above one megawatt.</p>



<p>Today, the lessons learned in New York have spread to eight other U.S. states that are now homes of union-led climate jobs coalitions. Dr. Skinner plans to “expand the initial solar study to an annual study of the U.S. clean energy workforce, looking at all parts of the clean energy economy, and then conducting similar studies in other states and at the national level.”</p>



<p>For those of us in Canada, the question remains: why don’t we see this move “from ambition to action” in our country?</p>



<p>According to feminist economist Dr. Marjorie Griffin Cohen, the respondent for the event, it is a matter of economic priorities and political perspective. Despite the push amongst trade unions for clean energy jobs and a ‘just transition’ through groups like Blue-Green Canada, Canada’s transition “is not happening that way: we’re increasing our oil exports, and we’re increasing our oil production.” While unions and workers advocate to change our understanding of the economy, growth, and productivity, governments are stuck greening a small proportion of jobs to make them “compatible with Canada’s path to net zero emissions”, while increasing fossil fuels production.</p>



<p>Like Dr. Cohen, we are left to ask “How can we expand the areas of the economy that are already relatively low contributors to climate change problems, but also shift the focus to meet people’s real care needs?”&nbsp; The answer is to shift employment away from carbon-intensive jobs to employment in care-giving, Dr. Cohen suggests, contributing to the economy, improving human well-being and protecting nature.</p>



<p>From an organizing perspective, Dr. Skinner had her own answers.</p>



<p>For Skinner, greening the economy in a labour friendly, equitable way starts with expanding union-based training infrastructure and establishing mandated targets for diversifying employment cohorts. And by connecting labour to clean energy by way of project labour agreements, Climate Jobs Coalitions can set up direct-entry, pre-apprenticeship programs. These can help to redirect money from low-quality piecework projects to high quality and high impact union-led clean energy projects.</p>



<p>But this kind of work needs a clear definition of the value and importance of union climate jobs, and these projects need to help frontline and historically marginalized communities achieve a higher quality of life to maximize their impact.</p>



<p>Dr. Skinner’s climate jobs coalition success story is compelling.</p>



<p>Start with unions. Learn from workers. &nbsp;Help them to propose, organize, and develop clean energy projects in cities and regions to create high quality, unionized jobs for those most in need. That is how how we collectively move “from ambition to action.”</p>

<p><em>Written by Elaine Coburn in conversation with Angele Alook</em></p>



<p>Indigenous peoples have inherent rights to the lands on which they have lived since time immemorial. That is the message from Professor <strong><a href="https://profiles.laps.yorku.ca/profiles/alook/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Angele Alook</a></strong>, member of the Bigstone Cree Nation and faculty in the School of Gender, Sexuality and Women’s Studies. These rights, Alook emphasizes, bring responsibilities to protect the land and the water.</p>



<p>Violation of Treaty rights by the colonial state interferes with these sacred responsibilities to the natural world. This is a matter of sovereignty. It is also a matter of climate justice.</p>



<p>Fossil fuel companies operating on Indigenous lands destroy the land and water. It is against this destruction that First Nations take up their Treaty Rights, Alook explains, led by Water Protectors, who are responsible for the sacred duty to protect the Earth.</p>



<p>Water Protectors became known to international publics in the movement to challenge the Dakota Access Pipeline on the lands of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. Fulfilling traditional and ongoing responsibilities, Alook explains, Indigenous women and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people led the way in honouring their responsibilities to the land and standing against settler colonial ecological violence.</p>



<p>When Water Protectors at Standing Rock were sprayed with hoses and violently detained by the police, their steadfast defense became a stand against settler colonial dispossession, against violence targeting Indigenous women and genderqueer people, and for Indigenous survivance.</p>



<p>As Anishinaabe intellectual Gerald Vizenor explains in his book, <em><a href="https://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/nebraska-paperback/9780803210837" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Survivance: Narratives of Native Presence</a></em>, such moments refuse settler colonial attempts to reduce Indigenous peoples to victims. In Alook’s words, survivance means that, “Indigenous peoples have always been here, we are here now, and we will be here for future generations.” Protecting the water participates in the creation of new futures for Indigenous peoples, for their cultures and for their knowledges.</p>



<p>In Alook’s home territory of Treaty 8, Cree and Dene people are fighting to protect the Lower Athabasca River system, which includes the Peace-Athabasca Delta. This water system is critical, Alook explains, if First Nation members are practicing their Treaty rights and maintain relationships with the river and the land that sustain their distinctive ways of living and being. A 2010 study on the Athabasca River done by the Firelight Group, Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation, and Mikisew First Nation, called <em><a href="https://firelight.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/AsLongastheRiversFlowFullReport-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As Long as the River Run</a><a href="https://firelight.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/AsLongastheRiversFlowFullReport-2.pdf">s</a></em> emphasizes that the Athabasca river is at the very heart of their Traditional lands.</p>



<p>In keeping with this report, Alook emphasizes that without enough clean water in the river system, “we cannot access areas that matter to us culturally and spiritually and we cannot sustain our families on the traditional foods that keep us healthy.” Similarly, <em>As Long as the River Runs </em>explains, “Losing the ability to access creeks, side channels and tributaries by boat means losing access to the land. Losing access to the land means lost opportunities for language and knowledge transmission, and for maintaining connections between generations, as well as between people, animals,” and “waters that are at the heart of being Dene and being Cree”.</p>



<p>Protecting the river water from climate change is about protecting Indigenous futures. Water protectors enact Indigenous sovereignty by carrying out responsibilities to sacred lands. They delink from settler colonialism and provide gendered relinking to Indigenous knowledges. This renews land-based practices, which are necessary to fight climate change.</p>



<p>Alook concludes, “Our land-based knowledge’s are vital to Indigenous peoples but in an era of climate change, they matter to everyone. There will be no sustainable future without us.”</p>

<p><em>Written by Nathalie Elizabeth LaCoste Ling</em></p>



<p>In November 2022, the twenty seventh session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 27) to the United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change, was held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. The aim of this annual event was to bring countries together to take action towards climate goals established under the Paris Agreement and the wider Convention. Both Drs. <strong><a href="https://profiles.laps.yorku.ca/profiles/alook/">Angele Alook</a></strong> and <a href="https://twitter.com/graereed8">Graeme Reed</a> travelled to Egypt to participate.</p>



<p>In the event hosted by the <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/research/cikl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Centre for Indigenous Knowledges and Languages</a> on March 9, 2023, Drs. Alook and Reed shared their experiences attending COP 27 as Indigenous Peoples. The conversation was moderated by Dr. Sean Hillier, Interim director of CIKL.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both seasoned attendees of COP, Alook and Reed reflected on the changes they have observed and experienced over the different conferences they attended. Dr. Alook, Assistant Professor in the School of Gender, Sexuality and Women’s Health at YorkU and a member of Bigstone Cree Nation in Treaty 8 territory, had previously travelled to COP 25 as part of the RINGO (Research and Independent Non-Governmental Organizations) delegation sent by York University and as part of the Indigenous caucus at COP 26. This year, she travelled as a researcher with the primary aim of conducting interviews with Indigenous climate leaders and activists as part of her research project, <em>Indigenous Climate Leadership and Self-Determined Futures</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Reed has been participating in the UN Framework Convention on climate change for 5 1/2 years. He has been to five COP meetings to date. Most recently, he attended as part of his work with the AFN (Assembly of First Nations) and the International Indigenous Peoples Forum on CLimate Change, the Indigenous Peoples Caucus. He has played an integral role in establishing Indigenous spaces at COP. As a postdoctoral fellow at YorkU, Dr. Reed worked with Dr. Alook in conducting interviews which coincides with his ongoing research that investigates the intersection of Indigenous governance, environmental governance, and the climate crisis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>COP27 marked the first time there was a dedicated space for ceremony and an self-funded Indigenous Peoples Pavilion, supported by NDN Collective. All events at the pavilion were live-streamed, and the space included a media zone and&nbsp;an Elders lounge. Dr. Reed emphasized that in addition to increases in the amount of physical space for Indigenous Peoples, there were also more Indigenous participants than past years, over 270 in total. He also noted the number of knowledge keepers in attendance, hosted by the Facilitative Working Group as part of the workplan of the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The importance of community was raised by Dr. Alook. She explained how Indigenous Peoples “have to act as a community when we are there.” She shared how intimidating the conference can be for many Indigenous Peoples. Some have never travelled such a long distance before. Some have faced incredible challenges in sharing their stores. Some continued to face discrimination at COP despite being invited guests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While positive changes were identified at COP27, the impact of Indigenous voices were not always captured in larger policy negotiations, according to Reed and Alook. The institutionalization of how the climate problem is articulated was raised by Dr. Reed. He emphasized that while representation of Indigenous Peoples has grown, decision texts that refer to Indigenous Peoples has declined since COP26. He suggested that more work needed to be done to examine the federal and international institutional structures that limit the inclusion of Indigenous voices, calling for decolonized climate policy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite laying out the critical work that needs to be done and the challenges of dismantling a deeply colonial system, the event ended on some positive words. Two key pieces of advice were shared (1) Get involved in local organizations. Several exist at YorkU, to advocate for decolonial approaches to climate change. (2) Learn more. Dr. Alook shared her new book, <a href="https://btlbooks.com/book/the-end-of-this-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The End of This World</a>, which goes more in-depth on howe we can make radical social changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both Alook and Reed intend on travelling to COP28 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates in November.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Written by Elaine Coburn, Associate Professor of International Studies, Glendon</em></strong> </p>



<p>In the struggle for a livable world, for each of us and for all of us, there are many from whom we draw strength. Some are close to us and some we know only through their words. Hermann Levin Goldschmidt, a German Jewish survivor of the Holocaust, is one who speaks directly across a half-century.</p>



<p>In the long shadow of the Shoah, Goldschmidt wrote <em>Contradiction Set Free</em>, first published in German in the 1970s and only recently translated into English. He wrote about his times, but they are familiar to us: he describes false prophets, genocidal violence, totalitarian dreams of domination and fascist hopes for supremacy, nihilistic despair and state surveillance and militarization. He warns of atomic and ecological destruction that threatens the end of human life and the end of much of the natural world. In surveying so much death and so many dangers, Goldschmidt wrote plainly about the “far greater pervasiveness of evil in relation to good”.</p>



<p>And yet Goldschmidt did not counsel despair. Instead, he issued a passionate and anguished call for each of us to respect the singularness of every Other. He reminds us of our profound responsibilities to each human being and to the natural world, in their distinctive differences from ourselves:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Every human being counts, and that means every human being without exception, of every age and of both (sic) sexes, weak and strong, sick and healthy; just as every human being of every skin colour counts and every human being of every faith and every knowledge! And just as every human being has [their] own dignity and value, so does the environment of the human being, from nature to culture, have its own dignity and –especially as nature – its own literally irreplaceable value.&nbsp;</em></p><cite>Hermann Levin Goldschmidt</cite></blockquote>



<p>In a world whose diversity is known to us, Goldschmidt enjoins us to “hold our ground!” by living up to our responsibilities. This means that our own freedoms must serve the freedoms of others, allowing the contradictions among us to be free. This is not inevitable. It is a political and ethical choice we make to put our own freedoms in the service of others, to allow other human beings and the natural world to express their own particular, irreplaceable qualities. This gives life meaning, “as something more than its own existence”. For Goldschmidt, this act is an expression of love and it is upon this love that our survival depends.</p>



<p>In an era of climate change, we might follow Goldschmidt in seeking “a fundamentally new way” of being together with each other and with nature. This will require us to embrace all the distinctive ways that we know, together and as singular individuals, while holding ourselves accountable to each other. This demands scientific studies that root observation of climate change in systematically gathered evidence, spiritual and existential appeals that remind us of our duties to protect all life, immediate actions to mitigate and adapt to local effects of climate change, and artistic expressions that stir our imaginations and help us realize the urgency of transformation. As Goldschmidt reminds us, commitment to the Other, both human others and the others of the natural world, means embracing the irreducible and irreplaceable plurality of ways of being, knowing and doing.</p>



<p>Yet even in the act of writing, Goldschmidt worried that his arguments might not persuade anyone to action. “[W]ords” he observed, may “lead only to more words whose protest fails to eradicate the oppression against which they are aimed”. The possibility of failing to act against the oppression and destruction of other human beings, and of the earth, is always there. There are powerful actors who prefer profitable self-interest to the survival of many forms of life, including human life and the earth which sustains all of us. Many others suffer in circumstances of conflict and hunger that leave them with little beyond the immediacy of struggles for survival. The urgencies and exigencies of everyday life, even for the relatively more privileged, often loom larger than the most pressing existential questions.</p>



<p>Goldschmidt knew all of this from the agony of his own experience. He knew both the costs of inaction and the costs of standing against the destruction of human others and the other of nature. And yet he insisted, in an unashamedly moral and theological vocabulary, upon the possibility that each of us might act to turn away from evil towards the good. As the most profound and serious commitment, he asked us to respect the distinctive forms of life in other humans and in nature.&nbsp; He called upon us to be accountable, to each other and to the earth that sustains us, not only in our sameness but in our distinctive differences. When freely chosen, taking up this responsibility for new, more livable ways of being all together is an act of love -- and so our most serious duty and our most joyful possibility.&nbsp;</p>
