										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Black graduate students and faculty members at York have demonstrated a shared interest in organizing to begin conversations around what supports Black scholars at the University need to thrive and excel in their academic careers. Graduate scholars Britney Andrews, Jake Okechukwn Effoduh, Sharon Henry and Yohana Solomon, along with Dr. Jude Kong and Dr. Alvine Belle have connected to address this need and brainstorm concrete and actionable steps that can be taken to support Black graduate students at York. After sending a call to connect and receiving a plethora of positive responses to join the mailing list, the group of Black graduate students and faculty organized a gathering dedicated to creating a space for Black graduate students to freely discuss their experiences with one another.</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8">Held at Founders Assembly Hall, the in-person session began with a socializing period, where attendees introduced themselves to one another and became acquainted.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p><meta charset="utf-8">"The joy in their faces as they connected with fellow Black students spoke volumes. It's clear: we need a micro-community where students can find safety in vulnerability, sharing their concerns and supporting each other through the challenges they face on campus and in life, free from judgment," shares Kong. "A safe haven for these students isn't just about well-being; it's a home away from home, a sanctuary for their unique journeys. Here, Black students can meet, share ideas, and transcend boundaries, bridging contexts and specific situations.<br><br><meta charset="utf-8">The event also included a discussion period revolving around the needs of Black graduate students at York and how these unique needs can be met. Attendees were asked four questions: 1) What challenges do you face as a Black graduate student on or off campus? In your opinion, how can we as a community and the University address these challenges? 2) How do you envision a Black space on campus designed specifically for Black York graduate students? 3) What opportunities for building community do you wish were available at York? How important is it for you to connect with other Black graduate students? 4) Should we have a Black graduate council on campus? If so, what should the organizational structure look like? What activities should it engage in to address challenges Black graduate students experience?</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:33.33%">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full img-thumbnail rounded-0"><img loading="lazy" width="828" height="622" src="https://www.yorku.ca/gradstudies/wp-content/uploads/sites/184/2023/10/IMG_8908.jpg" alt="four people discussing shared experiences over a meal" class="wp-image-53528" srcset="https://www.yorku.ca/gradstudies/wp-content/uploads/sites/184/2023/10/IMG_8908.jpg 828w, https://www.yorku.ca/gradstudies/wp-content/uploads/sites/184/2023/10/IMG_8908-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px" /></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><sub>Attendees discussed shared experiences over a meal</sub></p>
</div>
</div>



<p>The answers to the questions illustrate the steps that the University can take to address systemic barriers Black graduate students face and help reduce the difficulties many Black scholars experience while navigating their academic journey at York. Three main areas of future support were identified by those in attendance: 1) additional funding; 2) the formation of a Black graduate student council; and 3) the creation of permanent space on campus dedicated to Black-identifying students.<br><br>Making additional funding available is important to alleviate some of the pressures felt by Black graduate students. Some attendees indicated that they faced housing and/or food precarity, which impacted their studies. Black international students described the difficulty and burden they felt as newcomers navigating a new country with limited economic resources and little social capital. Additionally, Black graduate students who are parents or care providers for those in their families expressed the need for additional financial support.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:33.3%">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full img-thumbnail rounded-0"><img loading="lazy" width="828" height="622" src="https://www.yorku.ca/gradstudies/wp-content/uploads/sites/184/2023/10/IMG_8909.jpg" alt="a couple of people getting food from the food table" class="wp-image-53529" srcset="https://www.yorku.ca/gradstudies/wp-content/uploads/sites/184/2023/10/IMG_8909.jpg 828w, https://www.yorku.ca/gradstudies/wp-content/uploads/sites/184/2023/10/IMG_8909-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px" /></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><sub>Food was served to facilitate conversation and collegiality</sub></p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.6%">
<p><meta charset="utf-8">Another essential initiative is the creation of a Black graduate student council. Often being one of few Black graduate students in their classes or cohorts, attendees discussed the extreme isolation they experienced within the academy. Forming a Black graduate student council would foster community building among Black scholars throughout their academic careers. The council would attend to specific needs such as advocacy for the creation of supports; increased awareness of current resources on campus, funding, and scholarships; retention of Black graduate students; and opportunities for post-doctoral research. This council will also be involved in planning events geared towards the academic success and social well-being of Black graduate students.<br><br><meta charset="utf-8">Attendees also flagged the significance of having a permanent space on campus dedicated to Black-identifying students. To effectively support Black graduate students, this space should be available seven days a week. Serving as a meeting place, Black graduate students can come together, connect with those in their communities and discuss their similar and differing experiences. Along with social support, Black graduate students can also provide one another with academic support in the space.</p>
</div>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p><meta charset="utf-8">"When students feel comfortable expressing their concerns, a beautiful transformation occurs. They not only open up to each other but also create a space for mutual support, resource sharing, and countless opportunities. This change not only reduces dropout rates but also unlocks the dormant potential of YorkU's invaluable resources," says Kong.<br><br><meta charset="utf-8">Those who attended the session indicated that with further promotion of future events, more members of the Black graduate student community will be able to join in on the conversation. Overall, the event received positive feedback. The in-person meeting demonstrated an overwhelming need for the continued engagement of Black graduate students on campus to help reduce the difficulties so many Black scholars experience while navigating the institution.<br><br><meta charset="utf-8">“All of us at FGS are thrilled by this development, and we are grateful to the students and faculty who have so generously and enthusiastically committed their time and expertise to building support for fellow Black scholars at York,” remarks Alice MacLachlan, Vice-Provost and Dean, Faculty of Graduate Studies. “We see support for such conversations as an important part of our broader material commitment to decolonization, equity, diversity and inclusion, expressed in an April 2023 FGS Faculty Council Motion.”</p>

<p>Bringing a valuable graduate student perspective to the table, Shyam Patel has been working as a Graduate Assistant with the Faculty of Graduate Studies, to mobilize the <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/gradstudies/idp/">Individualized Development Plan</a> (IDP), a tool that supports graduate students in identifying their goals and skills as they consider academic and non-academic careers. Patel, a doctoral student in the Faculty of Education, will continue working with Associate Director of Graduate Academic Affairs, Wesley Moir and Associate Dean, Cheryl van Daalen-Smith to actively share with students the opportunities and professional development that the IDP has to offer.</p>



<p>“FGS warmly welcomes the views and contributions of graduate students like Shyam, who is proving to be invaluable in assisting us to mobilize the Individualized Development Plan. With warmth, humor, and dogged determination, Shyam has and continues to bring the value of the IDP to a wide range of graduate communities this fall. In offering his own lived experience, students have been enraptured with his explanations of the ‘what’s-in-it-for-me’ aspect of the IDP.&nbsp;With Shyam’s offer to come back and provide a more in-depth workshop on the IDP, GPDs, and seminar leads have enthusiastically welcomed him into their classrooms to further support active participation in professional skills training and planning,” shares Wesley Moir and Cheryl van Daalen-Smith.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/gradstudies/wp-content/uploads/sites/184/2023/09/idp.docx">IDP Document</a> has been revamped to support graduate students in setting and communicating goals, starting with a self-assessment and reflection to look back on their academic and professional development success and to plan for the future. The framework identifies six thematic areas for graduate students to focus on: Career Exploration and Planning, Communication, Health and Wellness, Managing Time and Resources, Research Dissemination, and Teaching. Students can use the guiding questions provided in each thematic area to plan their next steps and opportunities. The <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/gradstudies/gpps/">Graduate and Postdoctoral Professional Skills</a> (GPPS) webpage, which can be used along with the IDP, is an additional resource to support graduate scholars by hosting all professional skill development opportunities from across campus in a single location.</p>



<p>Patel has worked with different programs to present the significance of the IDP at their orientations and graduate seminars. Students in programs such as Development Studies, Economics, Education, Interdisciplinary Studies, Kinesiology, Nursing, Philosophy, and Social and Political Thought have already employed the IDP framework, which displays a great representation of the many disciplines this tool can serve.</p>



<p>“The highlight has been meeting other graduate students, who, like me, often feel confused, overwhelmed, and stressed,” notes Patel. “I have spoken about my feelings of doubt and uncertainty as a graduate student, and how I have used the IDP to build relations on campus and to communicate my research more effectively.”</p>



<p>Patel will continue to work with Graduate Program Directors (GPDs), supervisors, and graduate faculty members to guide graduate students along the process of self-appraisal and goal setting toward a clearer path regarding what they’d like to do post-degree. With a renewed suite of materials geared directly toward educators, the IDP package now provides a lesson plan, worksheets, and PowerPoints in a pick-up-and-go style. It is FGS’ hope that grad educators and GPDs will make use of this new suite of educator resources so that the IDP can live more vibrantly within individual program offerings. Patel will also be working with the York University Graduate Students’ Association (YUGSA) and faculty/program Graduate Student Associations (GSAs) to provide further support and to integrate the IDP into Peer Mentorship Programs and Professional Development Sessions.</p>



<p>Patel sees many graduate students using the IDP throughout their time at York University as they work towards becoming the next generation of academics, educators, leaders, consultants, policy advisors, researchers, scholars, and thinkers.</p>

<p>Postdoctoral Fellows are among the most active researchers at York University and are a vital part of our community. In addition to the mentorship of supervisors and other faculty members, the Faculty of Graduate Studies (FGS) offers professional development opportunities, events, and resources to Postdoctoral scholars that enrich their professional development and help build networks on campus. </p>



<p>Postdoctoral Fellows can be proactive about their future careers by taking advantage of the <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/gradstudies/graduate-postdoctoral-professional-skills-gpps/">Graduate and Postdoctoral Professional Skills</a>&nbsp; (GPPS) program. This convenient tool hosts a variety of resources, which help postdocs grow and meet their career plans and goals. GPPS offers support in six broad areas: Career Exploration and Planning; Communication; Health and Wellness; Managing Time and Resources; Research Dissemination; and Teaching. The opportunities and resources available in the different areas help postdocs gain a well-rounded experience at York as well as obtain a set of robust development opportunities, including help with coordinating research projects, navigating publication opportunities, securing funding, and much more.</p>



<p>The workshops and resources offered by GPPS can be organized and kept track of through the <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/gradstudies/idp-postdoc/">Individualized Development Plan (IDP)</a>. The IDP is a useful tool, which prompts postdocs to start strategizing about the next steps within and beyond the academic world. The easily accessible framework encourages active participation in professional skills training and career management by motivating Postdoctoral researchers to conduct a holistic review of their current expertise and identify future short-term and long-term goals. The development of the plan is often a collaborative process that draws on the knowledge and feedback from supervisors and colleagues at the university. By sharing the IDP with others, postdocs can gain insight into how the skills acquired as part of their position at York may translate into other contexts.</p>



<p>Additionally, Postdoctoral Fellows have the opportunity to benefit from resources and workshops offered by the Career Centre, York’s Teaching Commons as well as York University Libraries, which hosts the&nbsp;Learning Commons. Workshops range from discovering new research tools to successful grant writing to teaching development opportunities. Postdocs should also consider attending sessions by Mitacs, &nbsp;Beyond the Professoriate&nbsp;(BTF), and the <a href="https://www.facultydiversity.org/">National Center for Faculty Development &amp; Diversity</a> (NCFDD) which are taught by professionals and are structured around cultivating and improving important professional skills. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Postdoctoral scholars can also connect with research centres and institutes focusing on research related to their areas of inquiry. Connecting with these units can provide valuable opportunities to network, participate in research events, and possibly become an official affiliate. A list of&nbsp;<a href="http://research.info.yorku.ca/organized-research-units/">research centres and institutes</a>&nbsp;at York can be found on the website for the Vice-President of Research &amp; Innovation.</p>



<p>Professional development events and opportunities are listed in the monthly Postdoctoral Fellows edition of the <em><a href="https://www.yorku.ca/gradstudies/fgsnews/">FGSnews newsletter</a></em>, which distributes information about funding, events, and opportunities of interest to our postdoctoral community. For general questions about postdoctoral affairs and resources on campus, please contact the <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/gradstudies/contact/fgs-staff-directory/#academic-affairs">Postdoctoral Services &amp; Professional Skills Coordinator</a>.</p>

<p>Following a highly competitive selection process, York University Postdoctoral Fellows&nbsp;<strong>Chiara Camponeschi and Ashlee Christoffersen </strong>have been named among this year’s recipients of the prestigious <a href="https://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca/">Banting Postdoctoral Fellowships</a>. Awarded by the Government of Canada, the Banting Fellowship is valued at $70,000 per year for two years and supports postdoctoral researchers who will positively contribute to the country’s economic, social, and research-based growth. The award is open to scholars who are devoted to research in three areas: health research, natural sciences and/or engineering, and social sciences and/or humanities.</p>



<h2>Chiara Camponeschi</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>Chiara Camponeschi is a postdoctoral fellow conducting research at the Dahdaleh Institute for Global Health Research. Her project, “Turning Moments of Crisis Into Moments of Care,” aims to rethink our approach to resilience and recovery in an age of systemic crises. By applying this model to the study of urban climate change, Camponeschi’s research provides practical solutions that can be leveraged in a variety of settings from offering policy prompts for the design of infrastructures of care to making contributions to capacity-building and community practice.</p>



<p>“The lens of crisis has continued to be invoked to reinforce a reactive stance to change, one driven by narratives of enclosure, disconnection, and austerity that are harmful to society--especially to already vulnerable groups,” says Camponeschi. “Crises, however, can be richly generative moments of rupture that reveal contradictions, incite action, and stimulate new visions. They present us with the opportunity to turn moments of crisis into moments of care.”</p>

<h2>Ashlee Christoffersen</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>Ashlee Christoffersen is a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Politics. Her proposed research aims to increase our understanding of how intersectionality can be applied in both policy and practice, with a unique focus on nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Titled “Operationalizing Intersectionality: Equality Policy and NGOs,” the project has great potential to achieve positive change by highlighting the limitations of some existing NGO approaches and by impacting Canadian policymakers’ growing interpretations of intersectionality.</p>



<p>“The question of how to apply ‘intersectionality’, the Black feminist theory that social inequalities shape one another, is one that many across different fields have long struggled with,” explains Christoffersen. “This is because the predominant approach to inequalities has been to address these separately and thus ineffectively.”</p>



<p>Christoffersen underscores the importance of her research in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, which both deepened pre-existing inequalities and raised awareness of how they are intersecting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>York University celebrates seven recipients of the prestigious Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship for 2023.</p>



<p>The award, presented by the Government of Canada, aims to support first-rate doctoral students who undertake graduate studies in the fields of social sciences and humanities, natural sciences and/or engineering, and health. Candidates are evaluated based on three equally weighted selection criteria: academic excellence, research potential, and leadership. All seven YorkU recipients will be awarded $50,000 annually for up to three years to support their research projects.</p>



<p>This year’s scholars have proposed innovative solutions to challenging problems&nbsp;through their projects, which can develop into positive change for our community locally and globally. &nbsp;</p>



<h2>Areej Alshammiry, Sociology</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>Alshammiry’s project explores the practice of "double punishment”, where non-citizens or foreign-born individuals in Canada are criminalized and rendered deportable. The research particularly focuses on double punishment’s impact on those who are unremovable because they are stateless (non-citizens everywhere) but inadmissible on the grounds of criminality.</p>



<p>“Driven by the politics of the War on Terror, these processes lead to increasing cases of statelessness by decisions like citizenship stripping of foreign-born persons or deprivation of citizenship to those without one. However, such measures often target already marginalized communities and are often arbitrary as they are driven by racial, ethnic, religious, and national discrimination,” states Alshammiry.</p>



<p>This innovative project undertakes the important work of revealing the lived experiences of stateless individuals and can positively contribute to policy frameworks on statelessness and abolition.</p>

<h2>Jordan Krywonos, Physics &amp; Astronomy</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>The PhD study proposed by Krywonos considers gravitational waves, which are ripples propagating across the fabric of our Universe. As the gravitational waves travel, they carry information about their source, providing an avenue to study previously inaccessible sources such as an orbiting pair of primordial black holes that are proposed to compose a portion of dark matter. Thus, this ground-breaking research on gravitational waves could help illuminate the nature of dark matter.</p>



<p>“Given that the identity of dark matter is among the most important outstanding questions in cosmology, discovering primordial black holes would revolutionize our understanding of the Universe, and provide a new means of probing its origin,” reveals Krywonos.</p>

<h2>Marissa Magneson (Cree-Métis, Citizen of the Métis Nation of Ontario), Education</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>Magneson’s outstanding application was ranked&nbsp;2 out of 200 at the national competition for Vanier SSHRC files. Her proposed research contributes to the ongoing discourse of decolonial and artistic pedagogy, research-creation and Indigenous beadwork practices by challenging the ways in which education can look both inside and outside of the classroom.</p>



<p>Her project specifically seeks to uncover: 1) How beading supports Indigenous students in the reclaiming culture, strengthening identity, fostering community, healing inter-generational traumas, and developing a sense of belonging; and 2) How beadwork contributes to Indigenous pedagogy through creative storytelling while supporting ‘(re)conciliation’.</p>



<p>“Beadwork as Pedagogy actively responds to the Truth and Reconciliation (TRC) Calls to Action, suggesting that beading not only strengthens identity but also fosters healing and reconciliation,” shares Magneson.</p>

<h2>Austin Martins-Robalino, Civil Engineering</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>Martins-Robalino’s project investigates how new and emerging materials can be used in place of traditional materials when constructing shear walls, which are a key influence on how structures perform when subjected to loading from wind or seismic events. Martins-Robalino proposes that replacing traditional reinforcing steel rebar with a smart material like Superelastic Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) and concrete with Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECCs) could provide insight into making more damage-resilient and sustainable structures that recenter themselves after loading.</p>



<p>“Such resilient infrastructure would inherently improve the sustainability of structures reducing the equivalent carbon emissions over their service life,” says Martins-Robalino.</p>



<p>This cutting-edge project can help with progress towards safer and more sustainable construction and communities in line with UN Sustainable Development Goals.</p>

<h2>Greg Procknow, Critical Disability Studies</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>Procknow’s doctoral research illuminates the experiential claims of in-patients adjudicated not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder (NCRMD) to explore whether education leads to decarceration (absolute or conditional discharge) and to revalue education as a non-psychiatric method for recovery. His research will document the educative experiences of inpatients granted day-release privileges to pursue post-secondary education on campus in order to uncover: </p>



<p>1) What factors have facilitated or inhibited their inclusion in educational spaces; </p>



<p>2) How education has advanced their recovery plans; and </p>



<p>3) How do these inpatients perceive education’s role in qualifying them for an absolute or conditional discharge?</p>



<p>“This research is vital to learning how pedagogy impacts rates of decarceration, supports the reintegration of NCRMD into the community, reduces recidivism and rehospitalizations, and nurtures recovery,” opines Procknow.</p>

<h2>Cole Swanson, Environmental Studies</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>Swanson’s PhD study will use material-based art to explore the dynamic ecology of a bird colony with a stigmatized reputation, the double-crested cormorants (<em>Nannopterum auritum</em>). Working against dangerous imaginaries on cormorants fuelled by religious, settler-colonial, and extractivist histories and politics, Swanson will examine life in the colony to illuminate the entanglements between avian, human, and more-than-human worlds.</p>



<p>“Through socially engaged art practice, the apparent divides between our species will be broken down, stoking empathy and a community-based investment in the well-being and protection of these ancient creatures and their colony constituents with whom we share our lands and resources,” says Swanson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The project will culminate in a multisensory art exhibition composed of photos, video, and sound recorded from the colony, which will be shared with a diverse public for analysis useful in both scientific and social contexts.</p>

<h2>Anna Waisman, Clinical Psychology</h2>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>Waisman’s proposed research seeks to provide a novel, easily accessible approach to treating chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP). A study conducted at York University and the Toronto General Hospital published in PAIN with Waisman as the lead author found that patients who recall a greater number of event-specific pain-related autobiographical memories before surgery are significantly less likely to develop CPSP up to one year later. Building on these findings, Waisman’s PhD project will develop a remotely-delivered intervention that will train individuals to be more specific in the retrieval of their memories after surgery, with the aim of preventing chronic postsurgical pain.</p>



<p>“This work addresses a significant public health need. By creating a brief and easily accessible intervention, our plan is to deliver effective pain management to virtually anyone with a computer,” shares Waisman.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>FGS is excited to host its inaugural “2023 Fostering Black Scholars - Scholarship Success Workshop” for incoming and current graduate students. The event will be held on Monday, August 28<sup>th</sup> and is being hosted by FGS’ Scholarship and Award Team, led by Richolette Freckleton, Associate Director, Research, Scholarships &amp; Awards.</p>



<p>Attendees can gain an inside view on how to successfully complete award applications and leverage all the resources available externally and internally at York. The goal of this workshop is to share new funding opportunities to support Black scholars, such as the Bennett Family Graduate Scholarship for Black and Indigenous Students as well as other scholarships and awards. Additionally, the workshop will cover resources and guides available for developing successful grant proposals, writing reference letters for scholarship applications, and making the overall application stand out.<br></p>



<p>Students can also find out about the self-identification forms and questionnaires implemented by FGS. The optional self-identification questions in award applications are important to determine eligibility for funding opportunities targeting specific equity-deserving groups and implement funding equalization measures. Students can include relevant information in the special circumstances form on their applications to explain any personal circumstances (including gender, race, diversity, ability, sexuality, health disparities, educational access, etc.) that have played a role in shaping their path in order to allow for a fair assessment of their research productivity.</p>



<p><br>Students would not want to miss the featured speakers including seasoned Black faculty members: <strong>Dr.&nbsp;Andrea Davis</strong>, Professor, Dept. of Humanities; <strong>Dr.&nbsp;Jude Dzevela Kong</strong>, Professor, Dept. of Math &amp; Statistics; and <strong>Dr.&nbsp;Tokunbo Ojo</strong>, Associate Dean, Students, Faculty of Graduate Studies.</p>



<p>Attendees can also gain advice from their colleagues, and other graduate scholars who hold prestigious awards including <strong>Joseph Agyapong</strong>, Susan Mann Dissertation Awardee (2023), PhD student in Mechanical Engineering; <strong>Balikisu Osman</strong>, Vanier Scholar (2020), PhD student in Environmental Studies; and <strong>Danielle Washington</strong>, CIHR CGSD Awardee (2023), PhD student in Nursing. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The panelists will speak on their personal experiences, scholarship successes, and how to successfully leverage all the resources available. The panels will address common questions that are important to consider such as: What challenges did you face when completing your scholarship application? Who did you lean on for support? What resources did you find most helpful? What do you know now that you wish you knew before you started the program? And, more!</p>



<p>The online workshop creates a collegial space and aims to bring people together to share experiences, learn from one another, and support each other’s efforts. Through this event, incoming and current graduate students can start building and keep developing a support network at York University. We encourage faculty members and staff to share this initiative with their incoming and current graduate students. For more details and registration, please visit our <a href="https://fgs.apps01.yorku.ca/machform/view.php?id=244147">web page</a>.</p>

<p>Alaa Ibrahim and Carly Magnacca, two outstanding York doctoral scholars, are named recipients of the 2023-2024 Autism Scholars Award.</p>



<p>The community of scholars fostered by this Scholars Awards Program excel in the creation of new knowledge of child autism that positively increases the province’s capacity for diagnosis and assessment of autism and a strengthened treatment system. Ibrahim and Magnacca will each receive a one-year award of $20,000 to advance their research, which can lead to improved treatments and healthcare policies. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Alaa Ibrahim</h2>



<p>Alaa Ibrahim will be starting her PhD in the Clinical-Developmental Psychology program at York University in September. Her PhD research focuses on examining flourishing in autistic youth. Flourishing is the term used to describe individuals achieving wellness and is associated with high levels of positive mental health. Her study examines existing positive mental health interventions for autistic youth, in addition to understanding the experience of flourishing in a marginalized/racialized autistic community in Canada.</p>



<p>The important topic undertaken by Ibrahim will help gain an understanding of Canada’s marginalized groups in terms of their flourishing and well-being and inform intervention design for these populations. Additionally, this dynamic study can provide researchers, clinicians and policymakers with autistic experiences that can help ensure all youth with autism, including those from marginalized groups, are supported to flourish.</p>



<p>Outside of her cutting-edge research, Ibrahim has participated in international collaboration projects with the Word Health Organization as a therapist and a trainer of a parent-mediated intervention in Canada, Egypt and Jordan. She is also starting her clinical training at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.</p>

<h2>Carly Magnacca</h2>



<p>Carly Magnacca will enter her first year of the PhD program in the Clinical-Developmental Psychology program at York in the fall. She has worked with autistic individuals for several years in many different roles, including as a Research Analyst at the Azrieli Adult Neurodevelopmental Centre at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and Chair of the Kids Brain Health Network’s Policy Advocacy Research Training Committee.</p>



<p>Magnacca’s research aims to better understand the experiences of autistic youth who previously received Intensive Behavioural Intervention (IBI) and explore the impact of these intensive interventions to better inform policy and families’ intervention decisions. IBI is an evidence-based, intensive behaviour analytic intervention designed to support young children with autism and has been demonstrated to improve cognitive functioning and adaptive behaviours.</p>



<p>Her work is split into two parts. Study A involves comparing the long-term outcomes of individuals who received IBI to those who received other intensive interventions or no intensive intervention. Study B involves interviewing a subset of individuals who participated in Study A regarding their experience of receiving (or not receiving) an intensive intervention.</p>



<p>Magnacca’s study can be essential to help families understand the long-term outcomes of intensive interventions and guide them to make the choice that would benefit them the most. Moreover, the results of the research can aid policymakers in education and social service systems when making decisions about interventions that should be funded and made widely accessible.</p>

<p>Dear colleagues,</p>



<p>I am pleased to inform the York community that we have successfully concluded the search for the next Vice-Provost &amp; Dean, Graduate Studies.</p>



<p>The search committee, chaired by Provost and Vice-President Academic Lisa Philipps and comprised of graduate-affiliated faculty, staff and students from across the university, undertook a thorough internal search process which attracted excellent candidates. On June 27, the Board of Governors concurred with my recommendation that Dr. Alice MacLachlan be appointed to the position of Vice-Provost &amp; Dean, Graduate Studies for an initial period of five years, commencing on July 1, 2023. </p>



<p>Dr. MacLachlan is an Associate Professor in the Department of Philosophy, in the Faculty of Liberal Arts &amp; Professional Studies, where she has been a faculty member since 2007. An experienced graduate supervisor with an established scholarly record and an active interdisciplinary research agenda, Dr. MacLachlan has served two terms as Graduate Program Director for Philosophy and is a full member of the Graduate Faculty at York. She has also taken on academic and administrative leadership roles beyond the Department of Philosophy, including serving for two years as chair of SexGen York, a member of the President’s Advisory Council on Human Rights, and two terms as Chair of the LA&amp;PS Petitions Committee.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><sub>Dr. Alice MacLachlan</sub></p>
</div>
</div>



<p></p>



<p>Dr. MacLachlan’s research considers apologies and moral repair; civility and injustice; and family ethics, focusing especially on LGBTQ+ families, also looking at the broader politics of sexuality. She is Co-Editor of Feminist Philosophy Quarterly, has published widely in the top journals in her field and, alongside her scholarly research, has contributed extensively to public conversations about philosophical research on television, radio, newspapers and other media. Her current SSHRC-funded research project is entitled&nbsp;<em>Civility and Solidarity</em>.</p>



<p>With extensive administrative service experience in the Department of Philosophy, at York University and in her profession, Dr. MacLachlan was honoured in 2017 with the York LA&amp;PS Award for Distinction in Research, Emerging Researcher Category, and was awarded a York-Massey Fellowship in 2013 and the President’s University Teaching Award in 2011. She is committed to the scholarly and professional mentorship of graduate students and has developed extensive resources and offered many programs to foster their success inside and beyond the academy.</p>



<p>I would like to thank the members of the search committee for their contributions to this important process. I am deeply grateful to Dr. Thomas Loebel, who has ably served the role of Dean and AVP, the Faculty of Graduate Studies for the past five years.</p>



<p>I look forward to working with Dr. MacLachlan as she brings her energy and expertise to this important role. I hope that all members of the York University community will join me in congratulating and welcoming her as a core member of the University’s academic leadership team as the Faculty of Graduate Studies continues to lead in the advocacy for and training of graduate and postdoctoral students and studies in Canada and internationally.</p>



<p><em>Please share this announcement with your colleagues as appropriate.</em></p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Rhonda Lenton</p>



<p>President &amp; Vice-Chancellor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Three York University graduates received this year’s Governor General's Gold Medals, which recognize the outstanding scholastic achievements of graduate students in Canada. The 2023 recipients are Lawrence Garcia, Kathleen Dogantzis and Aaron Tucker.<br><br>The Governor General's awards are considered the highest honour earned by exemplary Canadian scholars throughout every level of academia. This year’s awardees offered words of gratitude to their peers and mentors, and expressed what the medals mean to them, ahead of their Spring Convocation ceremonies.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<h2>Lawrence Garcia</h2>



<p>Garcia earned a master’s degree in Cinema and Media Studies. Before enrolling at York, Garcia’s academic trajectory was altogether different, having graduated in 2017 with a bachelor’s degree in engineering physics from the University of British Columbia. While working as an electrical engineer afterwards, an interest in cinema as a freelance film critic eventually led him to pursue his master’s degree in Cinema and Media Studies in order to explore movies further.<br><br>Garcia’s academic pursuits at York focused on experimental or avant-garde cinema, culminating in a thesis—“Signs of Genesis: A Study of Ambiguity in Contemporary Experimental Cinema.”<br><br>He credits York faculty for the support he received not just with coursework, directed study, and in-school activities, but also with external opportunities like academic conferences and grant applications.<br><br>“The medal is an incredible source of encouragement for me as I move forward with my studies,” Garcia says, who will be entering the PhD program at the University of Toronto’s Cinema Studies this fall, and will continue to explore experimental cinema.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<h2>Kathleen Dogantzis</h2>



<p>Dogantzis earned a PhD in biology, following the completion of a master of science at York University. Both degrees were done under the supervision of Professor <strong>Amro Zayed</strong> and saw Dogantzis’ work focus on honey bees and their importance, as well as their complex history as pollinators. Her dissertation—“Understanding the evolutionary origin and ancestral composition of honey bee (Apis mellifera) populations”—sought to gain a deeper understanding of the genetic composition of honey bee populations in order to make more informed decisions about their health and sustainable beekeeping.<br><br>Furthermore, Dogantzis’ research involved the development of molecular tools capable of genetically detecting Africanized bees, which are essential in biosecurity as they can help monitor the movement of populations and ensure the sustainability of apiculture practices in Canada and abroad.<br><br>“I am honoured to have been nominated and selected for this prestigious award. It means a great deal to me for my work to be recognized. My achievements would not have been possible without the support, mentorship, and contributions from my advisor and colleagues,” Dogantzis says, who looks forward to applying the skills, experiences and values she gained at York to a future role focused on sustainability.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<h2>Aaron Tucker</h2>



<p>Tucker earned his PhD in Cinema and Media Studies with research focused on facial recognition technology. His dissertation “The Flexible Face: Uniting the Protocols of Facial Recognition Technologies” looks at the triangulation of citizenship, the management of citizenship resources, and the production and maintenance of crises.<br><br>Tucker’s work considers how over the past two centuries, facial recognition technologies have been consistently at the centre of that triangulation and their ubiquitous place in the contemporary moment – through advancing technologies – has made it urgent to produce effective regulation and auditing of such systems and the artificial intelligence underlying how they work. Tucker credits his interactions with a number of interdisciplinary spaces at York—including schools and makers both inside and outside the Department of Cinema and Media Arts—for the growth of his understanding of facial recognition, and his ability to communicate arguments to different publics.<br><br>His work with Vision: Science to Applications (ViSTA) lab proved pivotal too with providing a foundation in learning about computer vision, and the support of research trips to London U.K., Vancouver B.C., and Austin, Texas, U.S.A.<br><br>His work has been published in the journals IEEE Technology and Society and Afterimage, and lead to participation in the 2022 Stanford-Leuphana Summer Academy in Berlin.<br><br>“I am so proud to be part of the long history of this very prestigious award, and, at the same time very grateful, to the many people who supported me in the Cinema and Media Arts department and outside academia. It is an individual award but I hope the folks who helped me know that they are a core part of it as well,” Tucker says.<br><br>In September 2023, Tucker will begin his SSHRC postdoctoral position at the University of Toronto where he will study the history of artificial intelligence in Canada as a techno-national project, similar to the other nation building activities such as the fur trade, the building of the national railroad, and/or the Canadarm.</p>

<p>Six York University graduands have been awarded thesis and dissertation prizes by the Faculty of Graduate Studies (FGS) for their outstanding scholarly work. The prizes are bestowed to celebrate exceptional master’s and doctoral research work from the recent academic calendar year. The value of the awards is $2,000 for doctoral dissertations and $1,000 for master’s theses. From creating the world’s largest dataset on honeybee genomics to demystifying the function of consciousness, these talented scholars are breaking new ground with their research.</p>



<h2>Master’s Thesis Prizes</h2>



<p><strong>Abdul Basit</strong> (MASc, civil engineering) for “Impact of Climate Change on Thermal Behaviour of Pavement Structures in Ontario.” Basit’s cutting-edge study was motivated by rapid alterations to the climate, the particular consequences of which can be seen in the performance of road infrastructure systems. Through his research, Basit developed a critical evaluation for anticipated climate change and how this could potentially cause changes to asphalt binder grades and variations in spring load restriction (SLR) periods across Ontario. His innovative work contributes to the discipline of civil engineering through its useful industrial conclusions, as is attested by Basit’s peers.</p>



<p>“The new generation of civil engineers will be increasingly reliant on a sound academic background in climate change to make appropriate and intelligent engineering decisions,” said Rashid Bashir, Basit’s supervisor. “Mr. Abdul Basit’s graduate training, and specifically his thesis, is a step in the right direction.”</p>



<p><strong>Melodie Lao</strong> (MSc, chemistry) for “Developing an Automated Nitrous Acid (HONO) Platform to Detect Emerging Pollutants in a Commercial and Domestic Environment.” Lao’s innovative research focused on the development and application of new methods to measure the important atmospheric component, HONO. This chemical can react with other atmospheric component to form highly toxic products. Only in the last few years has HONO’s importance indoors been considered, but it remains difficult to measure accurately. Lao’s work creates substantial impact in the field by advancing the ability to measure HONO indoors.</p>



<p>Cora Young, Chair of the Examining Committee, commended Lao’s study: “It was clear to the committee that Melodie’s contributions to the field of atmospheric chemistry are significant, greatly exceeding those typical for an MSc degree. Her work has and will continue to make an impact on a national and global stage.”</p>



<p><strong>Anna Waisman</strong> (MA, psychology) for “Investigating the Role of Autobiographical Memory in Post-surgical Pain Up To One Year after Major Surgery.” Waisman’s thesis investigated autobiographical memory before and after major surgery in 97 adult patients. The purpose of her study was to see if highly specific autobiographical memory could be a predictor for greater post-surgical pain. Her results showed that recalling higher numbers of pain-related autobiographical memories resulted in lower post-surgical pain.</p>



<p>Waisman’s groundbreaking project was the first study in this area, and her results point to immediate and tangible interventions that physicians can implement to reduce post-surgical pain in their patients. Her research was already published in the prestigious journal <em>Pain</em>.</p>



<h2>Doctoral Dissertation Prizes</h2>



<p><strong>Kathleen Dogantzis</strong> (PhD, biology) for “Understanding the Evolutionary Origin and Ancestral Complexity of Honey Bee (Apis mellifera) Populations.” Through her study, Dogantzis – who was also awarded a <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/gradstudies/2023/06/20/2023-gov-gen-gold-medal/">Governor General’s Gold Medal</a>—advanced knowledge in the field of bee evolution and population genetics and developed new tools to protect the beekeeping industry from the accidental introduction of the highly invasive Africanized bees. Dogantzis created the world largest dataset on honeybee genomics, which involved sequencing over 200 new honeybee genomes from all over the world. Her sophisticated bioinformatic analysis debunked a recent hypothesis that honeybees originated in Africa by providing evidence that honeybees originated in western Asia.</p>



<p>Chair of the Examining Committee Elizabeth Clare praised Dogantzis’ accomplishment. “Her applied tools are expected to have a massive societal and economic benefit, not just for Canada, but across the world.”</p>



<p><strong>Dylan Ludwig</strong> (PhD, philosophy) for “The Functional Contributions of Consciousness.” The substance of Ludwig’s dissertation tackled one of the most difficult problems in the philosophy of the mind: the function of consciousness. Many philosophers maintain that consciousness makes no contribution to the causal powers of the mind. Scientists, on the other hand, tend to assume consciousness must have some overarching, unitary function. Ludwig’s main thesis contrasted with both approaches by arguing that phenomenal consciousness makes varying functional contributions to different cognitive and affective processes. This outstanding study has already led to three publications in prominent peer-reviewed academic journals.</p>



<p>Ludwig’s supervisor, Muhammad Ali Khalidi, contended that his work “has the potential to change the terms of the debate.”</p>



<p><strong>Sara Pishdadian</strong> (PhD, psychology) for “Subjective and Objective Spatial Memory and Navigation Abilities in Aging and Amnesia.” Pishdadian’s dissertation investigated subjective and objective spatial navigation. She took a novel approach of integrating cognitive theory with clinical neuropsychology, video-game technology, and multivariate statistical methods to systematically investigate this skill in normally aging people and in individuals with medial temporal lobe amnesia.</p>



<p>Her innovative work makes significant contributions to clinical practice as well as to cognitive neuroscience theory. Several of the studies that make up Her innovative work makes significant contributions to cognitive neuroscience theory as well as to clinical practice. Pishdadian has published in the top international journals in her field, including&nbsp;<em>Neuropsychologia</em>,&nbsp;<em>Cortex,</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Learning and Memory</em>.</p>



<h2>Next steps</h2>



<p>FGS additionally nominated Ludwig and Pishdadian for the dissertation prize presented by the Canadian Association for Graduate Studies (CAGS). The CAGS-ProQuest Distinguished Dissertation Award recognizes Canadian doctoral dissertations that make significant and original contributions to their academic field. Winners will receive a $1,500 cash prize, a certificate of recognition and an invitation to attend the 61st Annual CAGS Conference, to be held in Victoria, B.C., in November 2023.</p>
