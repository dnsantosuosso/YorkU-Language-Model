<p>The 2023 Level Up series kicked off on September 26 with the Level Up Young Alumni Mixer at the Orange Snail Pub on Keele Campus. Hosted by Young Alumni Ambassadors Ali Rushdi (MBA ’19) and Avreen Kochhar (BHRM ’19), the event invited York alumni back to campus for an evening of food, drinks, music and a chance to meet other alumni to grow their professional and social networks.</p>



<p>To encourage networking amongst those in attendance, the evening included an icebreaker game of “Alumni Bingo,” which was a big hit for the attendees and allowed guests to branch out and meet new people.</p>



<p>One of the young alumni in attendance, Michael Pious (ECON ’20), shared his thoughts on the event.&nbsp; “I loved attending this networking event. I got a chance to learn so much from other alumni and what they are doing with their professional lives and their hobbies,” said Pious. “I also got to make connections with people I would not have met. Young alumni can make friends with like-minded people and even mentors from attending events like these.”</p>



<p>The Young Alumni Mixer marks the first Level Up series event for 2023-24 calendar, with events scheduled for the fall and winter terms. Level Up brings recent graduates together to grow and develop professional and personal networks, featuring alumni guest speakers who help recent grads in their career and life journey. The event series covers a broad range of topics that young alumni can use in both their professional and personal lives, as can be seen in the upcoming fall webinars, “Becoming an Entrepreneur: Young alumni panel and Q&amp;A” on October 17 and the “Working Abroad Alumni Panel” on November 7.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yorku.ca/alumniandfriends/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2023/10/Level-Up-Alumni-Mixer-story-header-1024x754.png" alt="" class="wp-image-27421" width="375" height="276" srcset="https://www.yorku.ca/alumniandfriends/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2023/10/Level-Up-Alumni-Mixer-story-header-1024x754.png 1024w, https://www.yorku.ca/alumniandfriends/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2023/10/Level-Up-Alumni-Mixer-story-header-300x221.png 300w, https://www.yorku.ca/alumniandfriends/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2023/10/Level-Up-Alumni-Mixer-story-header-1536x1131.png 1536w, https://www.yorku.ca/alumniandfriends/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2023/10/Level-Up-Alumni-Mixer-story-header-2048x1508.png 2048w, https://www.yorku.ca/alumniandfriends/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2023/10/Level-Up-Alumni-Mixer-story-header-768x565.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /><figcaption><em>Alumni networking during the Young Alumni Mixer</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>“Hearing from the various experts and alumni speakers on timely matters such as buying your first home, filing a tax return, or tips for entrepreneurs and growing your business, presents alumni with the opportunity to become knowledgeable on topics of interest or relevance to them, while also offering a community of support,” says Kochhar. When discussing what recent grads can gain from the Level Up series, Kochhar cites the value in learning from alumni leaders who have gained valuable life and work experience. As she explains, “what you gain from such events can vary based on what you set out to achieve and the effort you put forward, but having access to a wide range of people you can learn from is certainly a key benefit in my view.”</p>

<h2>Remembering Bruce Bryden, an outstanding York leader</h2>



<p>The York U Alumni Awards were inspired by Bruce Bryden who was an exceptionally committed and influential leader at York University for many years. He was a member of our first undergraduate class, was the founding president of the York University Alumni Association (now the&nbsp;York University Alumni Board/YUAB) and was a member and Chair of the York University Board of Governors - a 1960 inaugural York student and the first alum to have been appointed to the Chair.</p>



<p>The York U Alumni Awards recognize and honour his vision, exemplary leadership and extraordinary achievements.</p>

<p>Thirteen York University alumnae were recognized at Nuit Blanche in the Myseum of Toronto’s latest project, <em>The 52: Stories of Women Who Transformed Toronto. </em>The multi-year project celebrates the contributions of women to the city of Toronto in art, culture, politics, sports, technology, business and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>La version française suit la version anglaise.</em>&nbsp;</p>

<h5>A new gift from Desjardins to York University’s Innovation York will expand two critical accelerator programs that provide training and support in entrepreneurship and help promote innovation.</h5>



<p>The funding will continue both Desjardins and York’s commitment to fostering positive change for diverse local communities and uniquely global perspectives.</p>



<p>The gift supports two initiatives at York, with an infusion over five years to GENIAL (<em>Glendon Entrepreneuriat et Innovation A L’International</em>) and over two years to ELLA (Entrepreneurial Leadership &amp; Learning Alliance).</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to partner with Desjardins to create greater access and opportunities for women-led businesses,” says<strong>&nbsp;Jennifer MacLean</strong>, assistant vice-president, innovation and research partnerships at York University. “This partnership will enable York University’s YSpace to expand our impact in the community and continue to foster the skills and talents of young entrepreneurs.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>GENIAL is a bilingual initiative that offers training, extracurricular activities, and a research program in entrepreneurship and innovation.&nbsp;Desjardins’ gift will allow GENIAL to scale up its bilingual&nbsp;Entrepreneurial Skills Passport&nbsp;(ESP) program that is currently offered to Glendon students. Through the ESP program, GENIAL has trained a diverse population of students from liberal arts and business backgrounds, including domestic and international students enrolled in business, economics, communications, translation, international studies, sociology and psychology.&nbsp;GENIAL was launched in 2017 by&nbsp;<strong>Angelo Dossou-Yovo</strong>, associate professor of management and entrepreneurship.</p>



<p>Desjardins also supported York’s&nbsp;first accelerator focused on supporting women-led product- and service-based businesses.&nbsp;The donation to&nbsp;ELLA – a program created by women, for women – will&nbsp;support the program for the next two years. The funding will help with the sustainability of ELLA’s accelerator programming that&nbsp;provides&nbsp;women entrepreneurs with access to the community, knowledge and resources they need to scale their business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“With Desjardins’ support, YSpace’s ELLA program will be able to help more women entrepreneurs, particularly those in consumer packaged goods and professional services, take their businesses to greater heights and scale up into national and international markets,” said&nbsp;<strong>David Kwok</strong>, associate director, entrepreneurship. “This gift recognizes the value in supporting women-led product- and service-based businesses, providing them with resources as robust as those currently found in the tech sector.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To recognize their contribution and commitment, Desjardins is invited to take part in ELLA’s national advisory committee and act as subject-matter experts to help shape the program’s future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Entrepreneurs play an important role in our society. They are creating innovative solutions to the needs of Canadians and the challenges they face,” said Guy Cormier, president and CEO of Desjardins Group.&nbsp;“We are proud to support York University and their young entrepreneurs. They will help shape the world of tomorrow and we’re incredibly happy to be part of something that will give them the resources and tools they need to pursue their goals in life.”</p>

<h3>Le financement du Mouvement Desjardins permet d’élargir les programmes d’entrepreneuriat à York&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Un nouveau don de Desjardins à l’Université York permettra d’élargir deux programmes accélérateurs cruciaux qui offrent une formation et un soutien à l’entrepreneuriat et qui contribuent à promouvoir l’innovation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Le financement permettra à Desjardins et à York de poursuivre leur engagement envers la création de changements positifs pour les communautés locales diversifiées et d’offrir des perspectives mondiales uniques.</p>



<p>Le don appuie deux initiatives à York&nbsp;avec un apport sur cinq ans pour GENIAL (Glendon ENtrepreneuriat et Innovation À L’international) et un autre sur deux ans pour ELLA (Entrepreneurial Leadership &amp; Learning Alliance).</p>



<p>«&nbsp;Nous sommes ravis de nous associer à Desjardins pour améliorer l’accès et les possibilités d’entreprises dirigées par des femmes, déclare<strong>&nbsp;Jennifer MacLean</strong>, vice-présidente adjointe des partenariats en matière d’innovation et de recherche à l’Université York. Ce partenariat permettra au YSpace de l’Université York d’accroître son effet sur la communauté et de continuer à encourager les compétences et les talents des jeunes entrepreneurs et entrepreneuses.&nbsp;»&nbsp;</p>



<p>GENIAL est une initiative bilingue qui propose des formations, des activités extrascolaires et un programme de recherche sur l’entrepreneuriat et l’innovation.&nbsp;Le don de Desjardins permettra à GENIAL d’amplifier le programme de formation bilingue Passeport Compétences Entrepreneuriales (PCE) actuellement proposé à la population étudiante de Glendon. Grâce au programme PCE, GENIAL a formé une population étudiante diversifiée issue des arts libéraux et du monde des affaires, notamment des étudiantes et étudiants nationaux et internationaux inscrits à des programmes de commerce, économie, communication, traduction, études internationales, sociologie et psychologie.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GENIAL a été lancé en 2017 par&nbsp;<strong>Angelo Dossou-Yovo</strong>, professeur agrégé de gestion et d’entrepreneuriat.</p>



<p>Desjardins soutient également le premier accélérateur de York axé sur le soutien aux entreprises de produits et de services dirigées par des femmes.&nbsp;Le don fait à ELLA — un programme créé par des femmes, pour des femmes — financera le programme pendant les deux prochaines années. Ce financement contribuera à la durabilité du programme d’accélération d’ELLA, qui permet aux entrepreneuses d’accéder à la communauté, aux connaissances et aux ressources nécessaires pour développer leur entreprise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>«&nbsp;Grâce au soutien de Desjardins, le programme ELLA de YSpace sera en mesure d’aider davantage d’entrepreneuses, notamment dans les secteurs des biens de consommation et des services professionnels, à faire progresser leur entreprise et à s’implanter sur les marchés nationaux et internationaux, a déclaré&nbsp;<strong>David Kwok</strong>, directeur associé, Entrepreneuriat. Ce don reconnaît la valeur du soutien apporté aux entreprises de produits et de services dirigées par des femmes, en leur fournissant des ressources aussi solides que celles que l’on trouve actuellement dans le secteur de la technologie.&nbsp;»&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pour reconnaître leur contribution et leur engagement, les Caisses Desjardins sont invitées à participer au comité consultatif d’ELLA et à agir en tant qu’expertes en la matière pour façonner l’avenir du programme.&nbsp;</p>



<p>«&nbsp;Les chefs d’entreprise jouent un rôle important dans notre société en créant des solutions novatrices pour répondre aux besoins de la population canadienne et aux défis auxquels elle est confrontée, a déclaré Guy Cormier, président et chef de la direction du Mouvement Desjardins. Nous sommes fiers de soutenir l’Université York et ses jeunes chefs d’entreprise qui contribueront à façonner le monde de demain. Nous nous réjouissons de participer à un projet qui leur donnera les ressources et les outils nécessaires pour poursuivre leurs objectifs de vie.&nbsp;»</p>

<p>Parmin, a recent graduate of the Kinesiology program has been recognized for her contributions to York at various levels, including her program, college, faculty, and institution-wide.

<p>In addition, Parmin has held many roles with the Kinesiology and Health Science Student Organization (KAHSSO), where her presence and engagement were critical for helping students adjust to the impacts of COVID-19. She aims to stay engaged with KAHSSO through their alumni division and contribute to hosting workshops and information sessions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“York provided opportunities to allow me to get and develop a sense of community, and discover more about myself, benefiting my future decisions and aspirations," says Parmin. She was well-supported ever since her transition into university and saw it as her responsibility to foster the same experience for incoming students and future cohorts by improving York’s existing programs and training future student leaders that can drive positive change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parmin was honoured to be one of this year’s Alumni Golden GRADitude recipients, citing that she wishes to be a role model and encourages people to step out of their comfort zone, once you take the first step, everything else will follow. “I want to inspire others to work hard and contribute to the community” says Parmin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like so many Baby Boomers born in the 1950s, Deborah Spicer was the first in her family to attend university. As a student at St. Clement’s Private School for Girls in Toronto, she had two passions: journalism and theatre. She knew she wanted to pursue one of them when she moved on to university.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When she graduated from private school, she narrowed her choice between the University of Toronto and York University. She chose York because of the reputation of its Theatre program – and she is thankful for her decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her first week at York proved to be somewhat of a shock. When she walked into her Humanities 101 class, she was in a room with more students than had gone to her entire private school!&nbsp;</p>



<p>It didn’t take long for Deborah to find her stride. She dove into her studies for an Honours Bachelor of Arts English degree with a specialty in Theatre. She spent three years in residence, and immersed herself in campus life. She became a theatre reporter for the University newspaper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Deborah’s fondest memory of her time at York was a whirlwind ‘30 Plays in 20 Days’ theatre tour in London, England. Not only did she enjoy first-class theatre, she had the chance to talk with and learn from some of the best actors, directors and playwrights in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deborah emerged from her four years at York an ambitious, talented and confident young woman.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She launched into her first career as a news reporter and anchor in both radio and television in Ontario and British Columbia specializing in business, the markets and the courts.&nbsp;</p>



<i class="fas fa-quote-left h1 text-primary"></i>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> “My bequest to York University is an expression of gratitude for the doors that York opened for me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p> — <em>Deborah Spicer, York University alumna</em> </p>



<p>Later, while recuperating from a car accident back injury sustained on the job, Deborah filled her time by studying real estate and earning her licence. A second successful career was launched.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deborah is still grateful for her York experience. She feels that it built her knowledge, her curiosity and her confidence to succeed in two highly competitive fields.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why, as a York alumna who has led a successful and fulfilling life, she is leaving a gift in her Will to York University in support of future dedicated students embarking on their own professional pursuits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This gift is her way of saying thanks for all that York did for her — a positive legacy to inspire those who follow in her footsteps.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yorku.ca/alumniandfriends/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2023/07/sunnuz-photo.jpg" alt="Sunnuz Sarah Taheri" class="wp-image-26914" width="349" height="273" srcset="https://www.yorku.ca/alumniandfriends/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2023/07/sunnuz-photo.jpg 532w, https://www.yorku.ca/alumniandfriends/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2023/07/sunnuz-photo-300x235.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 349px) 100vw, 349px" /><figcaption>Sunnuz Sarah Taheri</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Sunnuz Sarah Taheri was a vibrant, charming young artist who expressed her passions through singing, poetry, painting and other visual arts. She took an active role in furthering women’s rights, protecting the environment, politics, philosophy, her community and society, and the plight of the poor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taheri completed a BA in English at York in 2005, although she loved her vocal jazz courses and singing classical, blues, soul and hip hop most of all. She hoped to study opera singing at Juilliard one day. Yet in 2013, at age 32, she died unexpectedly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Her death was tragic, and the greatest shock our family ever endured,” says her uncle, Farrokh Eshragi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The idea of creating a York University music scholarship in Sunnuz’s name came to us within a day or two after her passing. It was like lighting a small candle in the middle of the darkness that had befallen our family. We were inspired by the idea of keeping her spirit alive in this way; allowing what she might have enjoyed to continue on through others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Everyone in our family plus our friends and colleagues wanted to make it happen,” explains Eshragi. Through personal donations and a fundraising concert, $100,000 was raised, then doubled by a 2014 Graduate Studies Award Program. York University endowed the funds to create the Sunnuz Sarah Taheri Graduate Award.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This annual $5,000 award will help relieve some of the financial burden for outstanding students in the graduate fine arts program,” said Eshragi. “We hope this scholarship will help the students to dedicate more of their time to their work and feel less of the obstacles and difficulties that they might otherwise experience.”&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yorku.ca/alumniandfriends/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2023/05/Music-Student-Donor-Hall_20180829_8172-1024x683.jpg" alt="Sophie Bisson and Farrokh Eshragi" class="wp-image-25668" width="377" height="250" srcset="https://www.yorku.ca/alumniandfriends/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2023/05/Music-Student-Donor-Hall_20180829_8172-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.yorku.ca/alumniandfriends/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2023/05/Music-Student-Donor-Hall_20180829_8172-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.yorku.ca/alumniandfriends/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2023/05/Music-Student-Donor-Hall_20180829_8172-391x260.jpg 391w, https://www.yorku.ca/alumniandfriends/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2023/05/Music-Student-Donor-Hall_20180829_8172-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.yorku.ca/alumniandfriends/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2023/05/Music-Student-Donor-Hall_20180829_8172-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 377px) 100vw, 377px" /><figcaption>Sophie Bisson and Farrokh Eshragi</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The first student award recipient is Sophie Bisson, an opera singer and third year PhD student in musicology. Her doctoral work focusses on the musical lineage and legacy of Italian-Canadian soprano Lina Riccoboni Narducci (1915-1997).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Sunnuz Sarah Taheri Graduate Award helped Bisson pay for membership fees to organizations related to her field of research as well as attend and present her work at out of town conferences where she made important connections with other students and scholars.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bisson was particularly moved to meet Farrokh Eshragi and Sunnuz’s mother, Nazila Taheri. “I am grateful that this wonderful family valued my research. Meeting with them and making a personal connection was incredibly moving,” says Bisson. “I hope my work lives up to their gift but, mostly, I hope they find comfort in each year’s recipient and the legacy they are creating.”&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yorku.ca/alumniandfriends/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2023/05/YorkU-Newsletter-Shawnette-s-DSC_4894-edited-1.jpg" alt="Shawnette Bankasingh" class="wp-image-25735" width="286" height="1086"/></figure></div>



<p>Positive energy is more than just a feel-good fad for Shawnette Bankasingh (BA ’14, BEd ’15); it is something the York University alumna believes will impact people’s lives for the better. “Once you give good energy, it will always come back to you in various ways,” she says. “It’s a good practice of paying it forward.” </p>



<p>A recent recipient of the George Tatham Bursary Fund at York, Bankasingh doesn’t just preach about good energy, she teaches it. Armed with degrees in sociology and urban diversity consecutive education, Bankasingh is a certified primary school teacher. She is also a single mother of an eight-year old boy, Solace. While the Tatham Bursary helped her financially when she was completing her studies, Bankasingh was quick to spend most of the money she received on her students in marginalized communities where resources were limited. </p>



<p>“With such diverse students, I incorporated various teaching aids into my instruction to provide opportunities for engaging and enriched learning experiences,” she says. “I like to help out and give back, and that's something I try to teach my son and to pass along to people I encounter.” </p>



<p>Named in honour of York’s first dean, George Tatham (LLD ’78), the Tatham Bursary was established with contributions from more than 40 donors; the largest gift was made by one of Tatham’s students, John Terrance “Terry” Gardner (BA ’71). Gardner, who majored in geography and played varsity rugby at York, bequeathed more than $65,000, which was matched by the province to the Tatham Bursary endowment. May 2016 marked the 10th anniversary of Gardner’s death. While he was at York, Gardner was one of the so called “Tatham’s Toughies,” a group of exceptionally fit students who participated with Tatham in athletics, squash, tennis, boxing and weightlifting.</p>



<p>In York’s early years, Tatham, a geography professor, integrated his “whole person” philosophy into extracurricular student life and advised on the design of the physical education and athletics program. A man of many talents, he was also an accomplished concert pianist who made McLaughlin College, where he served as the master for 10 years, a centre of musical life on campus. Tatham was inducted into the York Sports Hall of Fame in 1985. He died at the age of 80 in 1987. </p>



<p>Since the Tatham Bursary was first awarded in 1998, around 70 students from McLaughlin College with demonstrated financial need have benefitted from it. Just as Tatham helped his students to develop as full, contributing members of society, recipients like Bankasingh are applying what they’ve gained from the award to assist others. </p>



<p>“The bursary reminded me to always try helping others in need, even when you’re not in a position to do so,” says Bankasingh, who teaches and volunteers in Toronto's Jane and Finch area. Through my lived experiences and education, I’ve been able to develop critical-thinking skills and see the world and my purpose in it differently. It’s empowering. I have a newfound sense of maturity and humility, and I want to help others believe in themselves and the power they have.”</p>

<p><strong>DID YOU KNOW? </strong>You can set up an annual student award in memory or in honour of someone for as little as $1,000 per year. Alternatively, a permanently named award can be created with a pledge or gift in your Will for a minimum of $25,000.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On June 28 and 29, York University's Black Alumni Network (YUBAN) and Sexuality and Gender Advocacy Alumni Network (SAGA) held the inaugural Black and Rainbow graduation celebrations. Many alumni, family and friends came to campus to celebrate the resilience and achievements of the Black and 2SLGBTQIA+ graduates of the class of 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hosted by Fikayo Aderoju (BA ’22) and Reni Odetoyinbo (BBA ’18), the Black Grad Celebration was marked by inspirational words from Professor Carl James (BA ’78, MA ’80, PhD ’86), Jean Augustine Chair in Education, Community &amp; Diaspora, and a rousing performance of Lift Every Voice and Sing by York student Ayokunmi Oladesu, a member of Vanier College Productions. </p>



<p>“For many Black university students, Black graduation ceremonies are opportunities not only to reflect on their journey through university, but also to celebrate the fact that despite the odds, challenges, doubts, and setbacks, they want to celebrate how they managed to obtain their post-secondary credentials that once seemed elusive and unobtainable,” said Dr. James.&nbsp;</p>



<p>New graduate Kobe Cargill (BA ’23) also took to the stage, sharing his experience as a Black international student, emphasizing the importance of recognizing the achievements of Black graduates.</p>



<p>“I am the first in my family and in my high school to leave Jamaica and get a university degree. I am doing this first and foremost for my family and friends back home,” he shared. “York is a large university with an extensive alumni network, and as Black alumni, we are laying a foundation for those to follow.”&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yorku.ca/alumniandfriends/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2023/07/20230629_183031-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-26524" width="404" height="303" srcset="https://www.yorku.ca/alumniandfriends/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2023/07/20230629_183031-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.yorku.ca/alumniandfriends/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2023/07/20230629_183031-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.yorku.ca/alumniandfriends/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2023/07/20230629_183031-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.yorku.ca/alumniandfriends/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2023/07/20230629_183031-1-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px" /></figure></div>



<p>An evening of celebration and recognition was held the following day for the 2SLGBTQIA+ class of 2023. On behalf of SAGA, Sara Elhawash (BA ’15) hosted the event, welcoming recent grads and alumni, while acknowledging their accomplishments and challenges in getting where they are today. The event featured food, music and remarks delivered by Alice Pitt, Interim Vice-President Equity, People and Culture, and alumnus/current PhD student Gin Marshall (MES  ’20) of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rights.info.yorku.ca/sexgen-york-committee/" target="_blank">SexGen</a>, York’s committee responsible for advising and advocating around issues and concerns of sexual and gender diversity.  </p>



<p>“I was truly honored to witness the power of unity and authenticity within the 2SLGBTQIA+ community. Having graduated in 2015 without a supportive network, it was heartwarming to celebrate alongside my fellow graduates who finally had the opportunity to embrace their true selves,” said Elhawash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The evening provided an opportunity to network in a safe space and share words of encouragement and advice for future grads. Marshall spoke about his experiences as a queer-identifying university student and his challenges in the workforce. “We know the pendulum is swinging back towards more discrimination, and there is lots of work to be done. Recognize yourself, frame your degree and make sure it represents who you are. It is essential for you to recognize this accomplishment,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with YUBAN and SAGA, these two inaugural events were supported by the Division of Advancement, the Division of Students and the Office of the VP, Equity, People and Culture, and had participation from faculty and staff across the university.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
