What was your experience at Glendon like?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I earned my Bachelor\u2019s in Science at Waterloo and realized I wanted to do something where I could bridge two worlds \u2013 my background in STEM and my fascination for global affairs. Coming from a background with a focus on engineering and science and going to Glendon felt like entering a completely different universe. It was an awesome experience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, Glendon\u2019s major selling point was the dual degree MPIA program offered in partnership with the University of Strasbourg. It wasn\u2019t just an exchange for credits but a complete degree that would allow me to be fully immersed in France for at least a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How did your Glendon experience contribute to your career?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MPIA offered a great opportunity to get immersed within public institutions through internships. Most of my cohort entered the Ontario Public Service, some of them got internships with the federal public service or with NGOs. I specifically wanted an enriching experience abroad.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I joined the European Union Study Tour and secured an internship at the European Commission in Brussels \u2013 that opened so many doors for me. The UNESCO offered me a very coveted internship and after that, I landed a position with the French Prime Minister\u2019s Office. After this, UNESCO offered me a full-time contract and I returned to work for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Glendon really contributed to this success because of the opportunity to do an internship, the flexibility to do it abroad and the bridge to the dual degree. I really loved a particular professor in the MPIA program \u2013 her name is Marie Lavoie. She taught science diplomacy and innovation policy and covered a lot of international ground. I felt like her courses set the path for me to later work at the UNESCO and the European Commission.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>As a Manager, Design Operations at Zapier, what does your job entail? What are your favorite aspects and what are the most challenging?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, I\u2019m shaping and leading a new design practice and team within Zapier, a fast-growing tech company that\u2019s fully distributed across the globe. As their first manager of Design Operations (also called \u201cDesignOps\u201d), I\u2019m confronted every day with the fact that our practice is still very nascent within the industry. I like to describe DesignOps as the hidden craft of designing <em>how<\/em> designers design, to drive maximum impact across the business.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wear several hats as an Ops leader: thought partner for design leaders, advocate to our executives, coach and guide for the people I manage\u2014all while being at the service of my \u201ccustomers\u201d: the designers themselves. I manage a wide range of operations that free up time and enable our designers and design leaders to focus on what they do and love best: improving the design and user experience of our products.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge of being a pioneer for your practice\u2014especially one that often operates and shines backstage\u2014is that you can\u2019t take anything for granted! You\u2019re constantly explaining and advocating for yourself, your team, your practice. You\u2019re always trying to find ways to make the invisible visible.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are your plans for the future \u2013 any personal or professional goals you\u2019re hoping to achieve?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u200b\u200bI\u2019m closing in on Year 3 of our return back to Canada after spending most of my career in Europe, and so far it\u2019s been full of incredible opportunities to build products, teams, and practices in the tech space from zero to one! Looking into the future, I feel like there\u2019s so much to learn and space to grow. Personally, I\u2019m about to embark on a new chapter\u2014becoming a new Mom and entering parenthood!&nbsp; I hope through that all of these experiences will be a bridge to an opportunity abroad again in the future \u2013 I\u2019d go back to Europe in a heartbeat!\u200b&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Aletheia D\u00e9livr\u00e9 (MPIA \u201918) is a technophile obsessed with creating better experiences where innovation meets social good.
