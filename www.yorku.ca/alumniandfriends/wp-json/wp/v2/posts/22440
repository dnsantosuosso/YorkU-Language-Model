Upon graduating, she was accepted into the Glenn Gould School, the Royal Conservatory\u2019s internationally recognized centre for professional training in music performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She has since performed with the Toronto City Opera, the Nathaniel Dett Chorale, Against the Grain Theatre, Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity, the National Arts Centre Orchestra and the Vancouver Opera, where she was recently a member of the Yulanda M. Faris Young Artists Program which engages, enriches, mentors and trains rising young Canadian opera artists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDuring my time at York I felt really grateful to work with some of Canada\u2019s best musicians such as Catherine Robbin, Stephanie Bogle, Raisa Nakhmanovic, Dr. Lisette Canton, Norma Burrows and Doreen Simmons who all invested so much into helping me to continue working on my craft. I am so grateful for these women who continue to encourage and support my career.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The winner of the City of Markham Black History Month Award, Jonelle regularly receives accolades for her performances (e.g., Opera Canada, CBC) and is in demand in opera and as a soloist with orchestras.
