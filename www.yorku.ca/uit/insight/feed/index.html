										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello!</p>
<p>We have implemented in some of the charts (400-Applications for now) the ability to zoom the information displayed there. This feature will expand the chart horizontally, however it will not increase the overall space where the chart is, meaning that scrolling will be necessary to see the rest of the information.</p>
<p>Here is how it works:</p>
<p>If you are passing the mouse pointer over a chart and you see the magnifying glass icon (bottom left-hand corner) like the one the image below, then you can zoom in that chart.</p>
<p><a href="http://insight.info.yorku.ca/files/2016/08/chart-zoom-1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-546 size-full" src="http://insight.info.yorku.ca/files/2016/08/chart-zoom-1.png" alt="chart-zoom-1" width="621" height="438" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://insight.info.yorku.ca/files/2016/08/chart-zoom-2.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-548 size-full" src="http://insight.info.yorku.ca/files/2016/08/chart-zoom-2.png" alt="chart-zoom-2" width="621" height="502" /></a></p>
<p>By clicking on the icon, you will see the pop-up menu below:</p>
<p><a href="http://insight.info.yorku.ca/files/2016/08/chart-zoom-3.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-549 size-full" src="http://insight.info.yorku.ca/files/2016/08/chart-zoom-3.png" alt="chart-zoom-3" width="627" height="519" /></a></p>
<p>This is how the chart will look like after a few zooms (please note that the horizontal scroll bar is now present):</p>
<p><a href="http://insight.info.yorku.ca/files/2016/08/chart-zoom-4.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-550 size-full" src="http://insight.info.yorku.ca/files/2016/08/chart-zoom-4.png" alt="chart-zoom-4" width="617" height="516" /></a></p>
<p>If you want to go back to the original state (like on the first image), just click on the menu option "Actual Size":</p>
<p><a href="http://insight.info.yorku.ca/files/2016/08/chart-zoom-5.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-551 size-full" src="http://insight.info.yorku.ca/files/2016/08/chart-zoom-5.png" alt="chart-zoom-5" width="611" height="513" /></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are using Internet Explorer 11 and are experiencing the error message "Your browser is not supported by Oracle BI Presentation Services.", you can fix this issue by adding the site to the compatibility view settings.</p>
<p>In Internet Explorer, click on the 'tools' icon on the top right, and then select 'Compatibility View settings'</p>
<p><a href="http://insight.info.yorku.ca/files/2015/06/tools.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-500" src="http://insight.info.yorku.ca/files/2015/06/tools.gif" alt="tools" width="552" height="557" /></a></p>
<p>The following window should open up:</p>
<p><a href="http://insight.info.yorku.ca/files/2015/06/cm1.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-501" src="http://insight.info.yorku.ca/files/2015/06/cm1.gif" alt="cm1" width="408" height="477" /></a></p>
<p>type 'yorku.ca' in the 'add this website' bar, and hit 'add'. It should then look like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://insight.info.yorku.ca/files/2015/06/cm2.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-502" src="http://insight.info.yorku.ca/files/2015/06/cm2.gif" alt="cm2" width="396" height="473" /></a></p>
<p>It should now work fine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Insight Enterprise Data Warehouse is now available.  We have rectified the following items since our last email:</p>
<p>1. Compatibility with Internet Explorer 10</p>
<p>Insight  will now function properly with Internet Explorer 10.  Before using the browser, we highly recommend you clear your cache and temporary internet files.  If you do not know how to do this, please submit a request to IT Service Desk (see below),  Note: Internet Explorer 11 is not supported.</p>
<p>2. Compatibility with recent versions of Chrome.</p>
<p>Insight  will now function properly with recent versions of Chrome.  Before using the browser, we highly recommend you clear your cache.  If you do not know how to do this, please submit a request to IT Service Desk (see below),</p>
<p>3. Insufficient Privileges for Existing Clients.</p>
<p>No privilege issues have been reported since the last email.  However, if your authorization has changed, please contact us to rectify the situation (contact details below).</p>
<p>The following item is still outstanding:</p>
