					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] First, on behalf of everyone in UIT, thank you so very much for expediting York’s IT system recovery by changing your Passport York password so quickly yesterday. As a result of your prompt assistance, we have been able to make significant progress in restoring York’s computer systems over the past 24 hours. Equally important, we still have no indication that any personal or sensitive institutional data was compromised during the cyber attack. If you haven’t changed your Passport York password yet, please go to https://mms.yorku.ca and make the change according to instructions sent yesterday. [&#8230;]]]></description>
