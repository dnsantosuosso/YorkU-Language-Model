<p>In alignment with the approach to public health recommended by Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, York University is transitioning from the current acute response to COVID-19 to one that takes a broader approach to community health management.</p>



<p>This approach is similar to that taken by other post-secondary institutions in Ontario.</p>



<p>Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health has asked post-secondary institutions to inform and educate community members on several public health issues of significance and to build on pre-pandemic public health efforts with a renewed focus on health and well-being.</p>



<p>Current levels of COVID-19 supports and services will be maintained until the end of respiratory season in late February 2023.</p>



<p>Select community health services for employees and students will be offered by the two units that led community health responses before the pandemic – Health Safety and Employee Well-Being (HSEWB) and Student Counselling, Health and Well-Being (SCHW).</p>



<p>Starting Monday, February 27, anyone seeking screening for COVID-19, will be redirected from YU Screen to the <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/self-assessment/">Ontario Ministry of Health’s self-assessment tool</a>.</p>



<p>Vaccination clinics and COVID-19 programming will be provided through a coordinated response by HSEWB, SCHW and other relevant units.</p>



<p><strong>Important reminders:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Until February 27, 2023, YU Screen continues to be available for anyone experiencing COVID-19 symptoms to receive support.</li><li>We continue to urge masking indoors. Level 3 masks and N95 masks are available to community members for purchase from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.yorku.ca/facilities/covid-19-return-to-campus-2/maps-for-masks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vending machines located on the Keele and Glendon Campuses</a>.</li><li>We strongly recommend that everyone receives a complete COVID-19 vaccine series, including third or fourth doses.</li><li>COVID-19 <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/bettertogether/vaccinations/">vaccine clinics</a> are available on campus.</li><li><a href="https://www.yorku.ca/bettertogether/rapid-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rapid tests</a> can be obtained on the Keele and Glendon campuses, while supplies last.&nbsp; Community members are reminded that rapid tests are also available at pharmacies and grocery stores.</li><li>York continues to follow the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ashrae.org/file%20library/technical%20resources/covid-19/core-recommendations-for-reducing-airborne-infectious-aerosol-exposure.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers’ Epidemic Task Force guidelines</a>&nbsp;on ventilation.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Employee case management will transition to align with pre-pandemic medical leave and accommodation processes. In the case of a workplace-related incident, including any reportable occupational disease exposure, the usual Workplace Safety Insurance Board (WSIB) processes should be followed.</li><li>Academic accommodation supports are available, for eligible students, through <a href="https://accessibility.students.yorku.ca/new-students">Student Accessibility Services</a>.</li></ul>

<p>Dear York community,</p>



<p>York University shares the concern of Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health (CMOH) about Ontario’s overwhelmed children’s hospitals. As such, we are joining him — effective immediately — in calling on the York community to wear masks in all indoor settings except when eating or drinking.</p>



<p>Children’s hospitals are filling and surgeries are being cancelled as a result of an influx of severely sick children due to the flu, RSV and COVID-19. Respiratory illnesses are expected to peak in early to mid-December. In response, the CMOH Dr. Kieran Moore is urging masking indoors and a renewed effort on behalf of everyone to protect public health.</p>



<p>This is an already stressful time of year with exams and assessments around the corner. To help reduce transmission during high density in-person classes, examinations, and other settings on campus, and maximize a good end of term, if you are able to wear a mask, do so. Treat it as a requirement for your own health and that of others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Committing now to a community of care approach at York is everyone’s responsibility as we do what we can to protect ourselves and others and, in particular, children and those who are most vulnerable in our society.</p>



<p><strong>Important reminders:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Level 3 masks and N95 masks are available to community members for purchase from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.yorku.ca/facilities/covid-19-return-to-campus-2/maps-for-masks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vending machines located on the Keele and Glendon Campuses</a>.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Community members are encouraged to self-assess by completing <a href="https://yorku.ubixhealth.com/login" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YU Screen</a> and should not come to campus if they are feeling unwell. &nbsp;</li><li>We strongly recommend that everyone receives a complete COVID-19 vaccine series, including third or fourth doses and a flu shot.</li><li>York is making COVID-19 <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/bettertogether/vaccinations/">vaccine clinics</a> available on campus — flu vaccines are also available at these clinics as well as at pharmacies.</li><li><a href="https://www.yorku.ca/bettertogether/rapid-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rapid tests</a> can be obtained on the Keele and Glendon campuses.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>We will continue to monitor public health indicators and follow public health guidance to help our community respond to the challenges of the pandemic and other respiratory illnesses.</p>



<p>As a community we solve problems together.</p>



<p>Please check <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/bettertogether/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YU Better Together</a> for more information on how we can work together.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Rhonda Lenton</p>



<p>President and Vice-Chancellor</p>

<p>York’s COVID-19 vaccine requirement is currently paused. However, the University is continuing to monitor public scientific evidence and public health advice and may need to pivot quickly.</p>



<p>As a result, all York University community members — students, faculty, instructors, and staff — are encouraged to keep their vaccination status up-to-date on York’s online <a href="https://yorku.ubixhealth.com/login">YUScreen</a> tool.</p>



<p>Vaccination is the best defence against severe illness and hospitalization from COVID-19, and the University urges all members of the community to receive a complete vaccine series and boosters when eligible.</p>



<p>You are asked to upload your vaccination record to YUScreen every time you receive a vaccination or booster&nbsp; to ensure your record is always current.</p>



<p>Records are automatically removed from the system after 11 months. If you can’t remember when you last uploaded your vaccination status, log into YUScreen and check your status using the Vaccination Record button. You can update your records by uploading your vaccination status and proof of vaccination on the tool as well.</p>



<p>Should public health guidance advise that York University mandate new policies, your updated record on YUScreen will help avoid disruptions in your ability to access campus.</p>



<p>To support your own health, York University will continue to run&nbsp;<a href="https://www.yorku.ca/bettertogether/vaccination/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vaccination clinics</a>&nbsp;at each of its campuses.&nbsp;More information can be found on the Better Together website at <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/bettertogether/">www.yorku.ca/bettertogether/</a></p>



<p>If you are feeling unwell, don’t come to campus, <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/bettertogether/rapid-testing/">test</a> for COVID-19 and use the self-assessment tool on YUScreen. Updating your status will, if necessary, trigger advice on what to do next and what supports are available.</p>



<p>Keeping your status updated on YUScreen is part of York’s community of care approach to COVID-19.</p>

<p>Despite the complex challenges we have faced, we have consistently balanced our responsibility towards the broader community with a wholehearted commitment to providing a welcoming, inclusive and engaging teaching, learning, and working experience for everyone at York University.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we return to the more typical in-person experiences we remember, I hope you will take advantage of every opportunity York has to offer as a 21st-century university, including engaging in work-integrated learning opportunities, participating or supporting athletics and recreation programs, joining clubs and organizations and attending events. These experiences have a profound impact on our lives. We benefit immensely both personally and professionally from the development of new connections, experiences and ideas that have the potential to shape our future success.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

York will continue to&nbsp;monitor the changing COVID-19 landscape on an ongoing basis to ensure the safety and well-being of the community. Please note that it may be necessary to pivot or introduce new measures if circumstances should change during the academic year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you may be aware, Public Health Ontario&nbsp;has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/publichealth/coronavirus/docs/contact_mngmt/management_cases_contacts.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed</a>&nbsp;the mandatory five-day isolation period for those who test positive for COVID-19 as part of the province’s plan to prepare for the fall respiratory illness season.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While York University continues to align our approach with the Province and the advice from the Chief Medical Officer of Health, we appreciate that this shift will undoubtedly cause various members of our community concern as we mark the return to largely in-person activities&nbsp;this Fall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We would therefore like to remind everyone about York’s community of care approach to health and safety:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Masks are <em>not </em>mandatory at this time but are strongly recommended especially in indoor settings when social distancing is difficult to maintain – N-95 and surgical masks are available for purchase at a discount on campus at locations such as York Lanes, the Life Sciences Building and Central Square and at Glendon’s Centre of Excellence, and will be available for free at various locations as required.

<p>With the Sept. 7 return to campus for in-person classes just around the corner, it’s important for the University community to know what to expect and how we can all stay as safe as possible.</p>



<p>In alignment with public health requirements, York has transitioned to a community of care approach to health and safety.</p>



<p>While it is no longer mandatory to wear masks, the University strongly encourages the use of masks, especially in indoor settings. While the requirement to be vaccinated is also paused, York strongly recommends that everyone receives a complete vaccine series, including boosters when eligible. Masking and vaccination remain the two most effective ways for everyone to protect their health. &nbsp;</p>



<p>While these protocols are on pause, the University continues to monitor the impact of COVID-19 and public health guidelines and will reinstate these mandatory protocols if it becomes necessary.</p>



<p>This newly updated website has all the latest information on what you can do and what the University is doing in response to the ongoing pandemic.</p>
