<p><em>Communication sent to International Students on March 19, 2020</em></p>



<p>We know the situation with COVID-19 is moving quite quickly so we hope you’re keeping well during this time.&nbsp; As Public Health advisories have gone out recommending social distancing, closing of restaurants and other safety measures, we want you to have some information about services, supports and resources available for all international students at York.</p>



<p>York International services remain open and accessible to all international students at York.&nbsp; See below for a new way of getting in touch with us!</p>

<p><strong>Social Distancing Can Still be Social!</strong></p>



<p>Social distancing doesn’t mean you’re alone!&nbsp; We’re moving our weekly Coffee Breaks online so you can still connect with other York students.&nbsp; Starting Monday March 23, we will run Coffee Breaks every weekday afternoon from 2-4pm.&nbsp; Connect with us online over video chat with your own cup of coffee from home and check in to see how your York community is doing.&nbsp; Our Student Staff and Peers will be available to chat, laugh, and share their strategies of staying healthy, active and connected during social distancing.&nbsp; Check out our YI Events calendar or our social media starting Friday for more info and how to join!</p>

<p>To all International Students at York,</p>



<p>Yesterday you received an email from&nbsp;<a href="https://coronavirus.info.yorku.ca/2020/03/message-to-the-community-on-yorks-response-to-covid-19/">President Lenton about York’s response to COVID-19</a>. This included information about suspending face-to-face classes and moving courses to online formats. As an international student, we understand you may have some additional questions and concerns about what this means for you.</p>



<p>I want to reiterate President Lenton’s message and say that York is here to support every member of the community during this time. The University is open and our services and supports remain open and available to you.</p>



<ul><li>York International and other services are available across campus to support international students.</li><li>International Student Advisors &amp; Immigration Specialists are on hand to answer your immigration questions.</li><li>Our UHIP staff will be available to answer questions about health insurance for international students. For questions regarding your UHIP coverage, please email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:uhip@yorku.ca">uhip@yorku.ca</a>.</li><li>Student Counselling &amp; Development will remain open for students looking to speak to a counsellor.</li><li>Residence Life and Housing staff will be on hand to support students living in residence.</li><li>Many services can be offered in alternate formats including over email, phone or virtually if you do not wish to come onto campus or will be away from campus.</li></ul>



<p><strong>TRAVELLING HOME?</strong><br>Some of you are likely considering travel to your home countries during this time. The move to online formats for classes gives you the flexibility to do so as you see fit. The University is considering options for final exams and will communicate decisions as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>You should also check for travel restrictions in your home country and/or in Canada as you plan your travels.&nbsp; There is some uncertainty in future travel restrictions so please consider and evaluate your options carefully in making a decision about your travel plans.</p>



<p><strong>RESIDENCES ARE OPEN<br></strong>If you are not planning on returning to your home country and live in residence on campus, current plans are for York residences to remain open.</p>



<p><strong>STUDY PERMIT INFORMATION<br></strong>We are also working to get information from Immigration, Refugees &amp; Citizenship Canada about anything that may be important regarding study permits. We will update you as information becomes available. Please make sure to check&nbsp;<a href="https://yorkinternational.yorku.ca/">York International’s website</a>&nbsp;regularly for these updates as well.</p>



<p>For questions regarding immigration and general international student well-being, please email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:iadvisor@yorku.ca">iadvisor@yorku.ca</a>.</p>



<p>We understand this is a difficult time and you may be feeling anxious and worried. We encourage you to continue taking preventative and safety measures including frequent hand washing, sanitizing surfaces regularly and staying home if you are feeling ill.</p>



<p>York will continue to update the community on the most current information on COVID-19 via the&nbsp;<a href="https://coronavirus.info.yorku.ca/">Coronavirus Information and Updates website</a>&nbsp;and through email.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Lucy Fromowitz<br>Vice-Provost Students</p>
