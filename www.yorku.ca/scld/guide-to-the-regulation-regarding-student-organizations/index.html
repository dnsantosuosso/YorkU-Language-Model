<p>The Regulation Regarding Student Organizations sets forth the privileges and obligations of Student Organizations to ensure that their activities and their financing are conducted in an <strong>Open, Accessible, Democratic, Non-Discriminatory, Legally and Financially responsible manner</strong>.</p>



<p>The Regulation came <strong>into effect on Jan. 1, 2023</strong>.</p>



<p>Student Community &amp; Leadership Development has created this guide to help understand the regulation, and how it may apply to Student Organizations. <strong>Should an inconsistency emerge between this and the regulation, </strong>please refer to the regulation and contact <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/scld/contact/">SCLD</a> for more information and support.</p>



<p>Throughout this guide are self-assessment tools and checklists to help you review various aspects of how your organization aligns with the Regulation. These tools are not intended to confirm whether your Student Organization is compliant or not, but rather help build understanding. The results of using these tools are not tracked back to your organization. </p>
