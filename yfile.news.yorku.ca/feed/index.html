These remarkable Ontarians demonstrate outstanding merit and excellence in many diverse disciplines, including the arts, science, education, sports and human rights,\" said Dowdeswell. “In reflecting the best of Ontario, they inspire the best in ourselves. On behalf of a grateful province, I offer my warmest congratulations.” The incoming Lieutenant Governor, Edith Dumont, will bestow the province’s highest honour to the new appointees in a ceremony taking place on Nov. 27. The 2023 appointees with York affiliations are: Dyane Adam, donor and former faculty A former principal of York University\'s Glendon College, Dyane Adam became the first woman and Franco Ontarian to serve as Canadian commissioner of official languages. She did so from 1999 to 2006, protecting and promoting linguistic duality across Canada. Her bold leadership and determination helped her overcome extraordinary challenges to succeed in writing a report, during her tenure as Chair of the French Language University Planning Board, that would serve as the government’s basis for legislating the creation of the Université de l’Ontario Français in 2018. She has also received numerous awards, including being made Chevalier del\'Ordre des Palmes académiquesde la France, Chevalier de l\'Ordre de la Pléiade de l\'Assemblée parlementaire de la Francophonie, and received theGolden Jubilee Medalof theOrder of Canadain 2013.

A new exhibit at York University’s Steacie Science and Engineering Library celebrates the history of technology and highlights York’s contributions to a milestone innovation more than 50 years ago. Zbigniew Stachniak On Sept. 25, 1973, members of the Canadian press gathered at the Royal York Hotel in downtown Toronto to witness what would become one of the most significant events in the history of computing in Canada. In the hotel, a Toronto-based electronics company, Micro Computer Machines (MCM), unveiled its MCM/70 computer – noted as the world\'s first personal computer, and one of the first microcomputers. “What MCM introduced that day was not only its portable personal computer but also a new computing paradigm that challenged the domination of massive and expensive mainframe computers requiring the kind of space and financial resources that could only be mustered by large corporations,” says Zbigniew Stachniak, an associate professor at York University’s Lassonde School of Engineering and expert on computer history. “Small PCs, claimed MCM, would redefine the relationship between society and computers and make widespread, personal information processing a reality.” The development of this groundbreaking technology is also traced back to York, with two former employees of the York University Computing Centre (located in the Steacie Science and Engineering Library) among the key software engineers working on the MCM/70 project. Gord Ramer and Dom Genner worked at York University before joining MCM. While at York, they developed the York APL programming language and that proved critical for the writing of software for the MCM/70 computer.

(Photo by Parkway Production courtesy of York University Computer Museum.) The MCM/70 @ 50 exhibit, organized by the York University Computer Museum and York University Libraries, celebrates the momentous appearance of the MCM/70 computer – a technological marvel that offered an early glimpse of a new digital reality. It pays tribute to the makers of the MCM/70 for their contributions to personal computing. Curated by Stachniak – who authored a book titled Inventing the PC: The MCM/70 Story – the exhibit features a complete line of MCM computers from the York University Computer Museum\'s MCM collection, including an MCM/70 computer and its first prototype. Among the exhibited images are those taken during the unveiling of the computer in Toronto, and those depicting former MCM engineers reunited with the MCM/70 computer, reflecting on the creativity, enthusiasm and dedication it took to realize their personal computer concept and deliver their creation into the new world of personal computing. The exhibit opens on Tuesday, Nov. 14 with a special event at 4 p.m. in the Steacie Science and Engineering Library at York University’s Keele Campus.

    window.ttsContent = "New report on sustainable investing highlights York’s leadership . The strong performance of York University’s endowment fund – exceeding national sector and international sustainability benchmarks while generating positive returns – is highlighted in the 2022 Sustainable Investing Report. As an institution, York is committed to ensuring sustainability is embedded in all aspects of University operations. Sustainable investing is one of the many ways York acts in accordance with its core values and contributes to a more sustainable future. The new report on sustainable investing outlines York’s leadership in the space and how the York University Endowment Fund employs a decarbonization strategy that integrates environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in the overall financial management of its portfolio. “This report is a representation of our commitment to reporting and transparency, and a mechanism to hold ourselves accountable to continuously evolve our approach as the connection between ESG factors and risk and return becomes better understood,” reads a letter in the report written byCarol McCaulay, vice-president finance and administration, andMary Traversy, Chair of the investment committee. “It also represents the most comprehensive compilation of data on sustainable investments in our endowment fund to date.” The data contained in the report is extensive, and underscores York’s deep commitment to making strategic and intentional investments through its endowment fund. From 2016 to 2022, the equity fund reduced the overall carbon emissions of its investments by 82 per cent and reduced its reliance on CO2 emitting equities. This led to a 78 per cent reduction in carbon footprint since 2016 and an 80 per cent decrease in the fund’s weighted average carbon intensity (WACI). Other highlights for the endowment fund include $103 million committed to sustainability-focused infrastructure funds and surpassing the Paris Accord standards in 2022 to now sit 45 per cent below the benchmark. In addition to sustainable investing, the University is taking steps to accelerate its institutional sustainability commitments and be a leader in transparent emissions reporting. Most recently, York became the first Canadian institution to release its own comprehensive emissions data and ecological footprint assessment, compiling and publicizing more information than ever before to inform and guide its sustainability initiatives.  For more information about sustainable investing at York, past reports are available on the University Secretariat website."

<h3>The strong performance of York University’s endowment fund – exceeding national sector and international sustainability benchmarks while generating positive returns – is highlighted in the <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/secretariat/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2023/11/Sustainable-Investing-Report-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2022 Sustainable Investing Report</a>.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>As an institution, York is committed to ensuring sustainability is embedded in all aspects of University operations. Sustainable investing is one of the many ways York acts in accordance with its core values and contributes to a more sustainable future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new report on sustainable investing outlines York’s leadership in the space and how the York University Endowment Fund employs a decarbonization strategy that integrates environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in the overall financial management of its portfolio.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This report is a representation of our commitment to reporting and transparency, and a mechanism to hold ourselves accountable to continuously evolve our approach as the connection between ESG factors and risk and return becomes better understood,” reads a letter in the report written by&nbsp;<strong>Carol McCaulay</strong>, vice-president finance and administration, and&nbsp;<strong>Mary Traversy</strong>, Chair of the investment committee. “It also represents the most comprehensive compilation of data on sustainable investments in our endowment fund to date.”</p>



<p>The data contained in the report is extensive, and underscores York’s deep commitment to making strategic and intentional investments through its endowment fund.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>From 2016 to 2022, the equity fund reduced the overall carbon emissions of its investments by 82 per cent and reduced its reliance on CO2 emitting equities. This led to a 78 per cent reduction in carbon footprint since 2016 and an 80 per cent decrease in the fund’s weighted average carbon intensity (WACI). Other highlights for the endowment fund include $103 million committed to sustainability-focused infrastructure funds and surpassing the Paris Accord standards in 2022 to now sit 45 per cent below the benchmark.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to sustainable investing, the University is taking steps to accelerate its institutional sustainability commitments and be a leader in transparent emissions reporting. Most recently, York became the first Canadian institution to release its own comprehensive <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/sustainability/wp-content/uploads/sites/125/2023/09/yeef_report_20230621_technical.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emissions data and ecological footprint assessment</a>, compiling and publicizing more information than ever before to inform and guide its sustainability initiatives. &nbsp;</p>



<p>For more information about sustainable investing at York, past reports are available on the <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/secretariat/board-of-governors/investment-committee/sustainable-investing-reports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">University Secretariat website</a>.&nbsp;</p>

Crawford will Chair the presentation, which features the work of six young presenters from different universities – including co-chair Jolande Fooken (Queen’s University), as well as Bianca Baltaretu (Justus Liebig University), Deborah Barany (University of Georgia), Gabriel Diaz (Rochester Institute of Technology), Jennifer Semrau (University of Delaware) and Tarkeshwar Singh (Pennsylvania State University). Presenters will share recent advances in techniques – such as neuroimaging, virtual reality and motion tracking – that allow researchers to address these issues in naturalistic environments for both healthy participants and clinical populations. The paper and presentation identify six areas where studying how the brain works in real-life situations has improved basic understanding of brain function. Researchers first discuss how the brain handles things like seeing objects and co-ordinating our hand movements, and then discuss applications of this knowledge to neurological deficits such as blindness, stroke and memory problems. This translational approach, which takes what is learned in the lab and applies it to rehabilitation, helps us better understand how our brains, bodies and thoughts work together in real-life situations, and is valuable for both basic and clinical research."

This event will also launch theDahdaleh Institute Planetary Health Research Councilwhich supports a collaborative research community of faculty, postdoctoral Fellows and graduate students committed to planetary health research at York University and beyond. The event draws attention to the need for clear associations between climate change and health, and to develop critical problem-solving interventions and advocate for climate action that advances well-being for all. The symposium will explore questions, such as: How do we do this while holding a critical view of the systems and structures which have led us into this climate catastrophe, including the ideologies of colonialism and capitalism that underpin the modern era? How do we advance effective and equitable solutions for planetary health that work against these systems and structures instead of upholding them? The day\'s agenda will include panel discussions with three themes featuring guest speakers. Water: This panel explores the role water plays at the confluence of environmental and human health. Speakers will discuss efforts to support vital biological and social functions of water in the face of our rapidly changing climate and how such efforts might be positioned to work towards more just, sustainable and integrated water management. Speaking on the topic of water will be: Deborah McGregor, a Canada Research Chair in Indigenous Environmental Justice and a professor cross-appointed with Osgoode Hall Law School and the Faculty of Environment & Urban Change at York University; Sapna Sharma, an associate professor in the Department of Biology at York University and York Research Chair in Global Change Biology; and Byomkesh Talukder, an assistant professor at the Department of Global Health at Florida International University. Moderating this panel will be Caroline Diana Duncan, a PhD candidate in civil engineering at York with a strong focus on optimizing drinking water in the Arctic using participatory approaches to system dynamics modelling. Land: This panel examines the role of land in achieving planetary health, taking a wide view across issues of food security, extractivism, urbanization and conservation. This includes examples of how land is inherently interconnected with people and the environment and how access to land and tenure rights are themselves a determinant of human and environmental health. Discussion on topics related to land will be led by: Dayna N. Scott, an associate professor and York Research Chair in Environmental Law & Justice with Osgoode Hall Law School at York University where she is also cross appointed with the Faculty of Environmental & Urban Change; James Stinson, a postdoctoral Fellow in Planetary Health Education at York University, cross appointed to the Faculty of Education and the Dahdaleh Institute of Global Health Research; Raphael Aguiar, a PhD candidate in the Health Policy and Equity program at York University and a Dahdaleh Global Health Graduate Scholar; and Sarah Rotz, an assistant professor in the Faculty of Environmental & Urban Change. This panel will be moderated by Nilanjana (Nell) Ganguli, a PhD student in the Faculty of Environmental & Urban Change. Air: This last panel addresses how air is brought into our approaches to planetary health, drawing together a range of fields related to emissions reduction, human well-being, air pollution and climate adaptation. Speakers will consider how air pollution disproportionately impacts low income and marginalized populations as well as the climate policy synergies of tackling air pollution that both damages health and impairs ecosystems. Participating in this discussion are: Cora Young, an associate professor and the Rogers Chair in Chemistry at York University; Eric B. Kennedy, an associate professor and area coordinator of the Disaster and Emergency Management program at York University; and Jean-Thomas Tremblay, an assistant professor of environmental humanities at York University. Moderating this panel will be Hillary Birch, a PhD student in the Faculty of Environmental & Urban Change at York University, where she is a SSHRC doctoral Fellow.
