She will enhance the reputation of innovation at York by providing world-class support to researchers and growing York\u2019s stakeholder network through national and international partnerships within the context of innovation, commercialization, entrepreneurship and knowledge mobilization activities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to joining York, Jennifer served as the vice-president, research and innovation for Aspire Food Group, a Canadian scale-up that develops low-cost, high-density ethical automated food-grade protein production systems. In this capacity, she was responsible for developing and implementing an innovation strategy to support partnerships with leading academics, technology firms and not-for-profit agencies. She supported the company\u2019s transition from start-up to scale-up, and successfully navigated unique challenges faced by private sector.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As operations manager and later executive director in 2017 of SOSCIP, an industry-academic research consortium that builds partnerships to foster industry adoption of transformative computing technologies, Jennifer successfully managed over 120 industry-academic research collaborations in Ontario and led a multimillion-dollar provincial funding renewal to support SOSCIP\u2019s growth and continuation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As director, collaborations at NGen, Canada\u2019s advanced manufacturing supercluster, she was critical in establishing $50 million in funding support for the launch of the COVID-19 response program, which catalyzed the development of Canadian-manufactured ventilators and N95 masks and other essential equipment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working with Mitacs, Jennifer developed the Converge program, a national funding program aimed at supporting Canadian small business growth through partnerships with multinational firms and academic partners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jennifer received her PhD in Medical Biophysics from Western University, London, Ontario.&nbsp;Her expertise in facilitating meaningful and large-scale partnerships and her dedication and passion for supporting inclusive, equitable and sustainable partnerships that benefit diverse communities and groups will make her an asset for York.
