Binsted<\/strong>, deputy provost, Markham, delivered the opening remarks to more than 40 attendees from a rich cross-section of industry collaborators, followed by a welcome from <strong>Alice Pitt<\/strong>, senior advisor, Markham academic strategic planning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Participants were asked to share insight and input into the development of this new program.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe success of Markham Campus depends on building strong partnerships with local employers and community members, that\u2019s why we are focused on providing opportunities for community engagement,\u201d said Binsted. \u201cThis event was exemplary, with over 40 participants from companies and non-profits across the Markham area. Building these partnerships is crucial since this will provide opportunities for collaboration in research, special projects, and experiential education.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Amir H. Chinaei<\/strong> delivered a presentation to introduce the CSSD program at Markham, which led to discussions on the potential for innovative co-op and internship programs, the benefits of experiential learning and the optimal length of these programs. Discussions also centred around what courses should be covered in the CSSD program \u2013 based on current trends and projections about where organizations and industries are headed in the next four to five years \u2013 with a focus on topics like AI (artificial intelligence), machine learning, blockchain, quantum computing and security.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attendees&nbsp;had an opportunity to share ideas on how their organizations can contribute to or engage with the program, including opportunities for future collaboration through course projects, guest lectures, co-ops and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the curriculum, the importance of interpersonal &#8220;soft&#8221; skills was discussed, with participants sharing notable things they learned, or wish they could have learned when they were in university.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attendees included representatives from large companies including IBM, AMD, Qualcomm and Rogers, Markham-based businesses such as Constellation HomeBuilder Systems, DecisivEdge, Hop In Technology, Iristel, and ISIGN Media, as well as the Regional Municipality of York, the City of Markham and Ontario Library Services Centre.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CSSD program promises a strong emphasis on\u202fproject-based, experiential learning through a self-paced, flexible schedule, coupled with the development of communication,\u202finterpersonal\u202fand other durable skills. In addition to in-depth technical knowledge and skills, students will learn about privacy, ethics, law\u202fand social and economic responsibilities and their application in computing. In-class and lab learning\u202fwill be complemented through project-based pedagogy\u202fwith exciting experiential education opportunities in Markham and York Region\u2019s thriving technology industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The organization of the event was a joint effort by the Lassonde School of Engineering and the Experiential Education Office at York University.
