For 30 years, he served as a full-time professor of physics at York University. He pioneered a new remote sensing laser technology known as Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR). Carswell founded the company Optech Incorporated, which commercialized the technology. In 2014, Carswell received an honorary doctorate in science from York University.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was aware of the many interests that York University and the Regent Park School of Music have in common, and I saw the potential for fruitful collaborations,\u201d said Carswell. \u201cI am excited to be here to celebrate this partnership that will enhance a broad spectrum of activities brought about by young people\u2019s special attraction to music.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>More than 100 people gathered in the Joseph G. Green Theatre on York University\u2019s Keele campus to celebrate the gift. The event featured musical performances by Grammy Award-winning vocalist Liberty Silver, who is also a two-time Juno Award recipient. Silver sang \u201cBe the Best You Can Be,\u201d and in the spirit of collaboration, the Regent Park School of Music Choir and the York University Gospel Choir sang \u201cGrateful,\u201d composed by Karen Burke, associate professor in AMPD. The event closed with a performance of \u201cMusic Speaks Louder than Words\u201d by the York Harmony Chorus (the chorus is an\u00a0<em>a cappella<\/em> ensemble based in Newmarket, Ont.)<\/p>\n<p>.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_236654\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-236654\" style=\"width: 450px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-236654\" src=\"https:\/\/yfile.news.yorku.ca\/files\/2016\/11\/libertysilver.jpg\" alt=\"Liberty Silver\" width=\"450\" height=\"315\" srcset=\"https:\/\/yfile.news.yorku.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/libertysilver.jpg 450w, https:\/\/yfile.news.yorku.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/libertysilver-300x210.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-236654\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Liberty Silver<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>\u201cMusic is a universal language that transcends borders, and I\u2019ve always felt that it\u2019s part of a well-rounded education,\u201d said Sylvena Solomon, whose daughter, Eryka Walters, 15, has been a student at RPSM for 10 years and sang at the Carswell gift celebration. \u201cRPSM has made my daughter who she is, and without funding, these children would not be exposed to the same programs and opportunities. Performing at York gives them exposure to an academic environment, and plants a seed of hope and self-confidence that they belong here and can accomplish their goals.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Operating in several regions of the city, RPSM is one of Toronto\u2019s most diverse music schools and provides extracurricular music education to youth that might not otherwise have access.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRPSM taught me how to conduct myself in front of an audience and gain confidence, which definitely helped me in my adult life,\u201d said Portia-Marie Siegel, a fourth-year communications student at York and 2012 graduate of RPSM, who attended the event. \u201cI had the best experience. This funding and partnership will help ensure that these children have a wonderful outlet for their creativity.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Prof. Carswell and the Carswell Family Foundation focus on community philanthropy that has a\u00a0direct impact. The foundation has previously supported York University with funding for new scientific research labs, awards and scholarships.
