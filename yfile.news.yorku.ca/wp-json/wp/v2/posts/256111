Together with a generous financial contribution, our students will have access to skilled Shopify mentors, providing them with rich experiential education opportunities as part of their academic studies.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Beginning this fall, the first cohort includes eight York Lassonde\u00a0Computer Science students who will split their time equally between Shopify\u2019s downtown offices and their coursework at Lassonde. The students will work alongside industry mentors and gain critical skills to solve real problems with modern technology.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As the classroom becomes much more porous and flexible, we are committed to ensuring that the student learning experience continues to evolve with these changes through the advancement of technology-enhanced learning and experiential education opportunities,&#8221; said Lenton. &#8220;This program\u00a0dissolves the gap between classroom studies and on-the-job knowledge by equipping students with transferable skills that allow them to evolve.&#8221;<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_256114\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-256114\" style=\"width: 880px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-256114\" src=\"https:\/\/yfile.news.yorku.ca\/files\/2018\/09\/Dev-degree-group.jpg\" alt=\"Shopify team members with York University administration and faculty members, along with eight Lassonde students enrolled in the Dev Degree program\" width=\"880\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"https:\/\/yfile.news.yorku.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Dev-degree-group.jpg 880w, https:\/\/yfile.news.yorku.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Dev-degree-group-300x99.jpg 300w, https:\/\/yfile.news.yorku.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Dev-degree-group-768x253.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-256114\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Above: Pictured from the far right are Lassonde Interim Dean Richard Hornsey, Andrea Ross, senior lead of computing education programs (Shopify), York President and Vice-Chancellor Rhonda Lenton,\u00a0Jean-Michel Lemieux (Shopify) and Alison Evans-Adnani (BSc &#8217;95), program lead, Toronto (Shopify).
