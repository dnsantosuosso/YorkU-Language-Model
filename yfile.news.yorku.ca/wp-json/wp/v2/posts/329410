A recent market forecast predicted global spending on cloud services will grow by 16.9 per cent annually to reach $1.3 trillion by 2025.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The York University School of Continuing Studies announced the launch of its new full-time <a href=\"https:\/\/continue.yorku.ca\/programs\/post-graduate-certificate-in-cloudops\/\">Post-Graduate Certificate in CloudOps<\/a>. The only full-time, university-level cloud operations program to be offered in Canada, it is designed to prepare recent domestic and international university graduates for entry-level cloud computing roles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMany enterprises today are contemplating a strategic move to the cloud. Because of this, cloud professionals are in high demand to manage the complexities of cloud migrations and to choose the right cloud vendor. People looking to enter this profession need the right mix of cloud competencies from organizational change management to data governance and flawless execution and deployment,\u201d says Claude K. Sam-Foh, cloud computing expert, curriculum developer, instructor and advisory member for the program. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/yfile.news.yorku.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Claude-K.-Sam-Foh_Instructor_Cloud_Computing-600x600-c-default.jpg\" alt=\"Cloud instructor Claude K.
