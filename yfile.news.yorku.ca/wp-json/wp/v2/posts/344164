Schulich School of Business and Faculty of Health researchers say that while as many as 90 per cent of people with autism are unemployed or underemployed, their study points to the benefits of having neurodivergent people in the workplace A groundbreaking study led by York University sheds light on the finding that individuals with autism are less prone to the \\\"bystander effect\\\" in the face of challenging situations, and makes a case for employing neurodivergent people. A psychological theory in which individuals are less likely to offer help or take action in an emergency situation when other people are present, the bystander effect has also been shown to apply to workplace settings. However, researchers have found that people with autism bring benefits to organizations because they are less likely to succumb to the bystander effect. Lorne Hartman Braxton Hartman Lorne Hartman, an instructor with the Schulich School of Business, says the study shows that \\\"to the extent that they would act if they saw something wrong, employees with autism were much more likely to intervene, regardless of the number of people present.\\\" Further to that, in situations where neurodivergent people would not intervene, they were more likely to identify the influence of others as the reason, whereas neurotypical employees were more reluctant to acknowledge this, says Lorne, lead author of the study. Lorne and his sonBraxton Hartman, a graduate student in the Faculty of Health at York who was a collaborator on the study, were inspired to look into this issue not only from their academic experience, but also because of personal experience \u2013 Braxton has autism and has been a public advocate on the issue since he was 12 years old. \u201cOne of the motivations here is that a lot of the current literature on autism comes from a deficit mindset. It\\'s basically saying these differences in autism are sort of exclusively negatives. We want to reframe that and ask, \u2018What are ways that some of these differences could actually be an advantage rather than just a negative?\u2019 \u201d says Braxton, whose research also focuses on autism. \u201cOne of the core areas that people tend to consider a deficit in autism is in terms of social interaction. We wanted to look at whether this is actually a positive to the extent that people with autism are less influenced by others when it comes to dysfunctional or unethical situations.\u201d Lorne has a background in clinical psychology and his main area of research looks at unethical behaviour in organizations. \u201cBut most importantly, in all of these cases, there were hundreds, maybe thousands of people who may not have actually been involved in the wrongdoing, but they should have been aware that it was going on,\u201d he says, summarizing his earlier research. \u201cSo having people around who are willing to blow the whistle, so to speak, is very important for organizations.\u201d The study, which was publishedthis weekin the October issue ofAutism Research,was created with collaborators from the University of Toronto. The research participants \u2013 employed individuals, 33 with autism and 34 neurotypical \u2013 were asked to weigh in on hypothetical scenarios involving everything from inefficiencies and inequalities to quality concerns. While the results are preliminary and more research is needed, the researchers say their work has important practical implications, especially considering that the rates of unemployment and underemployment for people with autism may be as high as 90 per cent, and even if they have higher education, that statistic only drops to 70 per cent. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at this from two angles. One is looking at helping organizations be more ethical and efficient, but also helping people like myself\u2013people on the spectrum\u2013find gainful employment by helping to change the societal understanding of autism,\u201d concludes Braxton.\"\r\n    window.buttonId = 1\r\n    window.ttsListeningSettings = {\"tta__listening_lang\":\"en-CA\",\"tta__listening_voice\":\"Microsoft Linda - English (Canada)\",\"tta__listening_pitch\":\"1\",\"tta__listening_rate\":\"1\",\"tta__listening_volume\":\"1\"}\r\n<\/script>\n\n\n\n<h3>Schulich School of Business and Faculty of Health researchers say that while as many as 90 per cent of people with autism are unemployed or underemployed, their study points to the benefits of having neurodivergent people in the workplace<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A groundbreaking <a href=\"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/full\/10.1002\/aur.3012\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">study<\/a> led by York University sheds light on the finding that individuals with autism are less prone to the &#8220;bystander effect&#8221; in the face of challenging situations, and makes a case for employing neurodivergent people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A psychological theory in which individuals are less likely to offer help or take action in an emergency situation when other people are present, the bystander effect has also been shown to apply to workplace settings.
