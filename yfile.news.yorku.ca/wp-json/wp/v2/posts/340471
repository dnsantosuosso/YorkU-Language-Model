York University is the first Canadian institution to earn the designation of a \u201cBest University for Commuters\u201d for its many sustainable travel options available to the community. The designation was awarded on Sept. 13 by Best Workplaces for Commuters, the North American authority for recognizing and assisting workplaces that provide exceptional commuter benefits to employees. With this designation, York joins institutions such as Harvard University, Princeton, Stanford and Yale, which have also been commended for options available to travellers. \u201cYork has spent many years building a strong transportation network, working with city partners to ensure our campuses are well-connected and accessible, and considering the ways we can lower our carbon footprint with sustainable travel options,\u201d said Carol McAulay, vice-president finance and administration. \u201cThis new designation is a celebration of that work and a reflection of what\u2019s to come. We\u2019re continuing to invest in sustainable travel options and are committed to working with municipal and provincial partners to advocate for more affordable transit options, including fare integration, to improve benefits for our community.\u201d To earn this designation, York was recognized for the variety of benefits and options it provides to students, faculty, instructors and staff who travel to and from campus. These are: Bike share \u2013 York was the first university in the Greater Toronto Area to partner with Bike Share Toronto and offer three bike share stations on the Keele and Glendon campuses. Secure bike parking and repair stations \u2013 two secured bike enclosures on the Keele Campus offer peace of mind to cyclists and four do-it-yourself repair stations on the Keele and Glendon campuses provide tools for quick fixes. Carpool incentives \u2013 a partnership with Zipcar enables easy car sharing, and preferred parking at a lower rate is available for those who regularly carpool to campus through the Diamond Pool Parking program. Electric vehicle charging stations \u2013 there are currently more than 30 charging stations available at the Keele and Glendon campuses. Glendon-Keele Shuttle \u2013 the shuttle offers service from 7:10 a.m. to 10:45 p.m. to all community members with a valid YU-card. These benefits are made available through Transportation Services, which has a mission to support the University community through smart transportation options that are consistently evolving. \u201cThe transit options to York have improved enormously since I was a student, with two subway stations to get you to class easier and faster,\u201d said Mike Layton, chief sustainability officer. \u201cChoosing sustainable travel is a great way for community members to contribute to York\u2019s net-zero commitment and reduce their personal carbon footprint.\u201d To learn more about transportation options at York, visit the Transportation Services department\u2019s website.
