The program is also expected to have IBM employees as guest lecturers in relevant classes, to share knowledge and experience that directly supports the curriculum. Discussions are underway to expand internship opportunities for York students and explore how the micro-credentials of learning badges already offered by IBM may augment and support learning opportunities for students.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYork University and IBM have been strong collaborators for several decades, spanning research and development, teaching and learning initiatives,&#8221; said Beth Bell, vice-president, enterprise and commercial, IBM Canada. &#8220;Today, we are excited to extend that partnership and welcome York University to our headquarters in Markham. Partnerships such as these are demonstrative of how cities, education institutions and technology companies can come together to shape the learning experience for students and build the skills of tomorrow.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Markham is already home to Innovation York, which is located at IBM, and to YSpace, which opened in downtown Markham in 2018. This new initiative with IBM further expands the University\u2019s presence in Markham and York Region.<\/p>\n<p>The technology incubator ventureLAB, which supports tech startups, is also located in IBM Canada\u2019s headquarters, along with IBM Innovation Space, a hub to more than 40 tech companies.<\/p>\n<p>Collaborative environments such as these create a strong opportunity for students with access to expertise, resources, and technologies needed to grow and enhance their skills.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis now gives students an additional opportunity to study closer to home at IBM, one of Markham and Canada\u2019s leading technology companies, and Markham\u2019s largest employer,&#8221; said Markham Mayor Frank Scarpitti. &#8220;Markham is a hub for talent in the heart of York Region, Canada\u2019s second-largest tech cluster.
