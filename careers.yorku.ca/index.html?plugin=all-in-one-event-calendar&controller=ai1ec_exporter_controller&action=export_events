 >\n<p>Like many students\, I believed I would enter the workplace with a c
 lear path ahead of me and was frustrated when this didn?t happen. It took 
 me a few years to shed this belief. What happened instead was that I tried
  on different roles either by choice or necessity to piece together a path
 . It is still a work in progress. My professional experiences in governmen
 t intersect with my identity as a young person and first-generation immigr
 ant. I am passionate about sharing my knowledge to support other students 
 like me to navigate the workplace and define their careers.</p>\n<p><stron

  would end up working in Human Resources\, I probably would have told you 
 no. I entered my undergraduate degree in psychology\, merely hoping to ent
 er a field of study that would allow me to help and work with others. Even
 tually\, I went on to study organizational behavior\, which sparked my pur
 suit of a career in Human Resources. Since graduating\, I have gained gene
 ralist experience in the private sector\, an HR professional designation\,
  and crossed over to the public sector\, where I now enjoy working in an i
 nnovative adult education role.</p>\n<p><strong>Registration is required</
