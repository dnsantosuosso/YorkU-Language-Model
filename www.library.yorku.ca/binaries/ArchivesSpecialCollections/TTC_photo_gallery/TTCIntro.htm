<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-family:Arial"><b>On Tuesday,
30 March 1954, approximately 5000 people gathered outside the Davisville Subway
Station to watch Premier Leslie Frost and Toronto Mayor Allan Lamport throw the
ceremonial switch that would mark the official opening of Canada's first
subway. After five years of construction and at a cost of $59, 000, 000, the
first trains left the twelve stations on the Toronto Transit Commission's new
Yonge Line at 1:30 PM. </b><b>&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-family:Arial"><b>The Yonge
Line spanned a distance of 4.6 miles from Davisville to Union Station. Earlier in the
day, the TTC tested the speed of its subway and covered the distance in twelve
minutes. Although the trains would run at much slower speeds when they carried
passengers, the travel time would be a significant improvement on the streetcars
that previously traveled along a similar route. The opening of the subway meant
that the streetcars would make their last journeys on the same day. </b><b>&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="font-family:Arial"><b>During the
first half hour of operation, token machines at various subway stations were
mistakenly dispensing eight tokens for a quarter. After the technical glitches
were corrected, the machines correctly dispensed three tokens for the same price
making the price of a single fair at slightly more than eight cents.</b><b>&nbsp;<o:p>
