<p>Herman Arthur Voaden was born in London, Ontario on January 19, 1903.  His family moved to St. Thomas, Ontario, in 1910 and his first acting experiences were in 1917 productions at St. Thomas Collegiate as a high school student.  He went on to attend Queen's University, with the intention of becoming a teacher like his parents and uncles and to continue his dramatic studies.  In 1927 he met his future wife, Violet Kilpatrick, who provided the inspiration for many of his female characters.  In addition to a teaching career that eventually brought the Voadens to Toronto, Herman Voaden became involved with various cultural organizations, ranging from community theatres to the founding of Canadian Arts Council and as a delegate to UNESCO.  His cultural nationalism also included running for public office under the CCF banner and was the driving force behind his "symphonic expressionist" dramatic works and productions.  Voaden received the Order of Canada in 1974 and was predeceased by Violet in 1984.  He died in Toronto at age 88, on June 27, 1991.  For a more complete chronology, a <A HREF="bio.htm"><U>biographical outline</U></A> has been provided.

<p>After completing high school at St. Thomas Collegiate in 1920, Herman Voaden went on Queen's University, in Kingston, where he graduated with a B.A. (Honours) in 1923 and an M.A. in 1926.  The subject of his master's degree was American playwright Eugene O'Neill.  Voaden continued post-graduate studies in both Canada and the United States, attending the University of Chicago in 1927 and studying playwrighting and drama with George Pierce Baker at Yale University in 1930-31.

<p>The completion of his master's degree at Queen's and most of his further graduate work was undertaken while he was also teaching.  From 1924 to 1926 he taught English at the Glebe Collegiate Institute and in 1926 went on to the Windsor-Walkerville Technical School as the head of the English department.  In 1927, when he was accepted into the doctoral programme at the University of Chicago, he had accepted an appointment as head of the English department at the Sarnia Collegiate Institute and Vocational School, hoping to finance and complete his studies while working.  Voaden then accepted the position of head of English at the Central High School of Commerce in Toronto in 1928 on the condition that he was able to start a theatre there.  During his Yale studies Voaden began to conceive his non-realistic "symphonic expressionist" play production style.  At Central High School of Commerce, he was able to implement and experiment with this "symphonic" multi-media directing and playwriting style from 1932 to 1943.  Voaden also served as a Course Director at both the University of Toronto and Queen's University in the 1930s.  His contributions to teaching also include the anthologies and play texts he edited for school study and published articles on theatre and education.  He retired from teaching at CHSC in 1964.  Additional information about his education, teaching and related productions can be found in a brief essay on his <A HREF="edteach.htm"><U>education and teaching history</U></A>.

<p>Herman Voaden was a significant Canadian playwright in the first half of the 20th century.  He was known for his non-realist, multi-media playwriting style, which he called "symphonic expressionism."  He began playwriting while in Sarnia, with his first completed work being <i>The White Kingdom: A Fantasy in One-Act</i> (1928).  He then wrote <i>Nothern Storm</i> (1929) and <i>Northern Song</i> (1930) where he sought to dramatize the Canadian wilderness and environment.  His fourth play <i>Western Wolf</i> (1930) also draws from Canadian sources and was completed to gain admission to  Yale.  Voaden also collaborated with painter Lowrie Warrener that year on <i>Symphony</i>, which was a conscious attempt to interpret Canada's various natural environments on human character.  His first produced play was <i>Wilderness</i>, which was written and performed while at Yale.  Another work which was undertaken at Yale, and later finished and directed by Voaden, at the Sarnia Drama League was <i>Earth Song</i> (1932).  His first "symphonic expressionist" drama was <i>Rocks</i> (1932) which was produced at CHSC.  Through the Play Workshop his next three plays were also produced: <i>Hill-Land</i> (1932); <i>Murder Pattern</i> (1936); <i>Ascend As the Sun</i> (1942).  He also collaborated with Frederick Jacobi and Godfrey Ridout during the 1940's and 50's.  His last produced drama, <i>Emily Carr</i> (1960), featured Amelia Hall in the 1960 Queen's University production by William Angus.  Voaden endowed the <a href="http://www.queensu.ca/drama/Voaden-Playwriting-Contest/">Herman Voaden National Playwriting Competition at Queen's University</a> to encourage Canadian playwriting. See the <A HREF="play.htm"><U>chronology of dramatic works</U></A> for a complete list.

<p>Voaden's theatrical career began with acting, in student summer productions at Hart House, at the University of Toronto in 1926.  While he would act in a handful of productions,  he would go on to produce and direct numerous productions over his career through his involvement with the Drama Club of Sarnia, the Sarnia Drama League, Central High School of Commerce (CHSC), The Play Workshop and the Queen's University play production courses.  Among the plays he produced are those by Bertram Brooker, T.S. Eliot, Eugene O'Neill, E.J. Pratt, T.M. Morrow, Dora Smith Conover and Arthur Burrows.  Among his experiments in theatrical production style was the adaptation of other literary genres to his symphonic expressionist style, including "theatral" poems by Yeats, Keats, Sandburg and Whitman beginning at CHSC in 1932 and the adaptation of novels, including Louis Hemon's <i>Maria Chapdelaine</i> staged in 1938.  His work extended into the realm of dance drama with <i>Symphony</i> and productions with Saida Gerrard and the Volkoff Ballet.  A <A HREF="prod.htm"><U>list of productions</U></A> provides a more detailed and substantial view of his vast and progressive directorial career.

<p>From the Second World War until his rediscovery by Canadian theatre historians in the mid-1970's, students and teachers knew Herman Voaden best for editing 13 play texts for school study.  His 10 play anthologies fall into two general categories:  those aimed at raising the quality  and inventiveness in the repertoire of school and amateur theatre groups, and those presented primarily as dramatic literature.  These include <i>Six Canadian Plays</i> (1930), <i>On Stage: Plays for School and Community</i> (1954) and <i>Look Both Ways: Theatre Experiences</i> (1975).  The last presents a synthesis of Voaden's own theatre experiments with staging poetry, the teaching of international classics and brief excerpts from the exciting new Canadian playwriting emerging in the early 1970's.  Voaden's work as a drama editor over half a century has not been equalled to date and constitutes a significant contribution to Canadian
education and culture. A bibliography of his <A HREF="pub.htm"><U>published and edited works</U></A> provides additional information.

<H4><font face="Arial"><a name="Critical Reception">Critical Reception</a></font></H4>

<p>Herman Voaden's non-realist playwriting and play production style has sharply divided critical opinion, even up to the present.  As early as 1932, the influential music and drama critic Lawrence Mason referred to Voaden as "the foremost figure in the Dominion's experimental theatre movement." Mason and others would view his works as progressive, evocative and the new direction for Canadian theatre, while others found his abstraction, use of non-realistic speech, ritual, movement and choral figures as simplistic and facile.  After his plays began to be published in the mid-1970's similar confusion and division occurred among critics; it has been his own reminder that the plays must be understood within their context of symphonic expressionism whereby Voaden's plays are again receiving increasing scholarly and critical attention for their contributions to a distinctly Canadian theatre.  The <A HREF="crit.htm"><U>critical reception</U></A> essay and bibliography provides an overview and information about articles and reviews of Voaden's plays and productions.

Until his death in 1991, Herman Voaden was an active member of numerous arts and cultural associations.  He was a participant in the Dominion Drama Festival competitions, a member of the Arts and Letters Club and an advocate for government assistance to the arts.  From 1945 to 1948, Voaden served as the founding president of the Canadian Arts Council.  In this capacity, he was an offical government delegate to the first UNESCO conference in Paris in 1946 that led to the founding of the International Theatre Institute.  His CAC role lead to his work on their 1950 submission to the Massey-Levesque Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences.  In his continuing association with the CAC, renamed the Canadian Conference of the Arts, Voaden assisted in the writing and submission of the CCA briefs to the Royal Commission on Broadcasting (1956) and the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism (1965-66).   As national director of the CCA in 1967, he led the research team which produced the two-volume CCA report <i>The Arts and Education</i>. From 1968 to 1970, Voaden served as president of the Canadian Guild of Crafts. His last major public involvement in arts organizations was to act as one of the playwriting judges in the
Theatre Ontario 1979-1980 Ontario Playwrights Showcase Festival. An essay on his professional <A HREF="assopol.htm"><U>associations</U></A> and related political involvement is available.
 
<H4><font face="Arial"><a name="Political Activities">Political Activities</a></font></H4>

<p>Voaden's advocacy for the arts and his involvement with such international organizations as UNESCO were also part of his strong interest in politics.  While his teaching and theatrical involvements limited his participation, he did, however, join the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in 1943 and contested the Toronto riding of Trinity in three federal elections and a by-election from 1945 to 1954.  While he never won office, he did increase the CCF vote in each election.  An essay on his professional associations and related  <A HREF="assopol.htm"><U>political involvement</U></A> is available.

<p>During the course of his life and work, Herman Voaden also acquired other materials that illuminate his playwriting and personal life.  Voaden retained a vast amount of his research materials from his playwriting and directing career, as well as a collection of playbills and inscribed books.  The research materials include clippings, texts, photographs and books, including a significant amount of research material for his play <i>Emily Carr</i>.  The playbill collection documents his years of avid theatre-going both in Canada and abroad.  The inscribed book collection reflect his wide circle of artist and writer friends. Additional information is available through the <A HREF="hvfa.htm"><U>finding aid</U></A> links.
