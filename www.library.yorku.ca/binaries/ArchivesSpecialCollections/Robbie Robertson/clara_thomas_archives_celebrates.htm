Robbie Robertson, the son of a Jewish father and a Mohawk mother, was
born in
1943. He learned to
play guitar at a young age and by 1958 was playing in and around
Toronto in such
bands as Thumper and the Trombones, Caesar and the Consuls and Robbie
and the
Robots. By 1960, he signed on to play with Ronnie Hawkins and the
Hawks. The
opportunity to play with the Hawks introduced Robertson to Levon Helm,
Garth Hudson, Rick Danko and Richard
Manuel, all members of the Hawks and all of whom would go on to form
The Band after
they ended their
relationship with Hawkins in 1964. The Band, of course, would release
their debut <i>Music
from the Big Pink</i> in 1968 and several more truly seminal rock and
roll
records, but first they would make their name backing up Bob Dylan on
his infamous 1965-1966 tour that unleashed his new electric
sound on the world. <o:p>

York University prepares to honour Mr. Robertson with an honorary
degree for his work as a musician, composer and music executive
as well as for his
contributions to Canadian society through his activism on prison reform
and
matters of aboriginal prisoner rights, the Clara Thomas Archives would
like to
take a moment to remember Robertson's formative years in Toronto with a
selection of images from the <i> Toronto Telegram</i> <i> photograph
collection</i>.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
