<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:75%">
<p><strong>Charlotte de Araujo</strong>, assistant professor, Faculty of Science, and&nbsp;<strong>Stephanie Quail</strong>, acting director of the Libraries’ Open Scholarship Department, were accepted into eCampusOntario’s Open Educational Resources Ranger (OER Ranger) program, an initiative designed to create and develop a network of OER advocates throughout Ontario’s post-secondary institutions.</p>



<p>A non-profit organization, eCampusOntario supports technology-enabled teaching, learning and innovation at Ontario’s publicly funded universities, colleges and Indigenous institutes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to eCampusOntario, the OER Rangers will “form a network of educators and practitioners interested in supporting the advancement of open education within their institution and are individuals who are passionate about education as a public good, and who promote OER as a sustainable approach to education.” There will be a total of 84 rangers from 46 Ontario institutions participating in this program.</p>



<p>York University’s engagement with OER continues to expand and grow, helping faculty advance United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4: Quality Education. OER are openly licensed, freely available educational materials that can be used, accessed, adapted and redistributed with no (or limited) restrictions.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>“With each semester, students have shared that purchasing textbooks is sometimes beyond their budget,” says de Araujo. “Being able to provide OERs, whether it is a chapter from a textbook or a worksheet to review information, can be a potential solution to help alleviate cost challenges and also enable students to freely review and revisit course material.”</p>



<p>To help support York University’s engagement with OER, de Araujo and Quail will host a live Zoom event, Discovering Open Education at York University, on&nbsp;<strong>Thursday, Nov. 23 from 2:30 to 4 p.m.</strong>&nbsp;During this event, attendees will learn about the following topics:</p>



<ul>
<li>what are open educational resources;</li>



<li>open licensing basics;</li>



<li>accessibility considerations and OER; and</li>



<li>learning more about H5P and Pressbooks – common OER creation tools.</li>
</ul>



<p>Faculty who are interested in using, adapting or creating OER are encouraged to attend this webinar, and can&nbsp;<a href="https://yorku.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0oc-qupz4pH9Uwt1l36aBOzKUZSd-tjBNK#/registration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">register now.</a></p>



<p>Additionally, faculty who would like to learn about OER in more depth can sign up for the Libraries’ fully asynchronous four-week OER mini-course. This course was initially developed in 2020 for Academic Innovation Fund (AIF) project leads, to help support them in turning a component of their AIF into an OER. Last fall, this course was opened up to all interested faculty and staff at York University.</p>

<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow" style="flex-basis:75%">
<i class="fas fa-quote-left h1 text-primary"></i>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I highly recommend taking the OER mini-course because it helps instructors develop the skills they need to find existing high-quality OER. Incorporating OER into your courses helps provide your students with access to course learning materials from the first day of classes,</p>



<p> — says Quail.</p>

</div>



<p>The online OER mini-course will begin on Monday, Nov. 20 and will wrap up on Monday, Dec.18. The four-module mini-course covers valuable topics such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>OER 101: What is OER? Including examples of OER and how they benefit students and faculty.</li>



<li>Copyright and Creative Commons licenses: An exploration of the range of open licenses available to creators and how to choose a licence that makes the most sense for their project.</li>



<li>Finding and evaluating OER: How to find OER for your subject area and evaluate them.</li>



<li>Create or adapt pre-existing OER: Learn about OER project management techniques, accessibility considerations, and OER tools and platforms.</li>
</ul>



<p>Quail will teach the Libraries’ OER mini-course this year.&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=GBNTNBFw1E-H8KQ4FsSb0O8idOr1Np9GvufNTQ8ZTlJUMlhVUFhBV1JQMUg0RUY5SkJNWkhSMzNPOC4u&amp;web=1&amp;wdLOR=c08443766-1BC7-6044-A802-3D189C03E090" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Register for the course now.</a></p>

These screenings are part of a series of in-person events being hosted at both the Keele and Glendon campuses from Monday, September 18 to Wednesday, September 27.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://yfile.news.yorku.ca/2022/06/21/cora-cody-appointed-indigenous-teaching-and-learning-librarian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cora Coady</a>, Indigenous Teaching and Learning Librarian at York University Libraries, remarks that York University Libraries is honoured to co-host these documentary film screenings, as they provide York students and staff with an opportunity to learn about the residential school system.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“The library is a partner in learning and teaching. The films tell the stories of residential school survivors,” says Coady. “Hosting the film screenings works to raise awareness and fosters a deeper understanding of historical injustices and the experiences of Indigenous peoples.”&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>
<cite>Cora Coady, Indigenous Teaching and Learning Librarian at York University Libraries</cite></blockquote>
</blockquote>



<p>The University will mark the day on Thursday, September 28 by hosting a hybrid community panel featuring the voices of staff reflecting on their learning journey, followed by a ceremonial fire at Skennen’kó:wa Gamig.&nbsp;There will be seven film screenings open to community members in several locations on the Glendon and Keele campuses, including Scott Library. Visit  <a href="https://president.apps01.yorku.ca/forms/view.php?id=280826" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Day for Truth and Reconciliation Film Screenings to RSVP.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>These events are in-person only; however, all films are available online through the University Libraries’ collection and are publicly available. They can be accessed here. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The list of films to be screened at Scott Library includes: &nbsp;</p>

<p>“At York University Libraries we not only facilitate access to information and promote critical thinking, but we have an ethical responsibility to build relationships and support Truth and Reconciliation initiatives,” says Coady.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>York University has a long-standing commitment to access, inclusion, equity and diversity; it is a leader in creating a more equitable, diverse and inclusive community on all its campuses. The National Day for Truth and Reconciliation is an important day to remind us to pause and reflect on the intergenerational harm that the Residential School systems caused to Indigenous Peoples across the country. It is a time to reflect on the strength and resiliency of Indigenous peoples. Importantly, it is a time for recognizing our shared responsibilities for creating new and better relationships with Indigenous people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Toronto prepares to launch the annual Caribbean Carnival that began more than 60 years ago to celebrate Black emancipation from slavery, York University Libraries celebrates its role in preserving and sharing the historic origins of the festival.</p>



<p>The archives of Kenneth Shah, a founding organizer of the event originally known as Caribana, capture the enthusiastic embrace of masquerade, dancing, and music through 30 years of text, photographs, and film—all of which provide unique insights into the cultural contributions of the Black and Caribbean communities. Kenneth Shah is a founding member of Caribana and the Caribbean Cultural Committee and was involved for more than 30 years with the festival celebrating Black emancipation from slavery.</p>



<p>Caribana arose out of a desire by West Indian immigrants to share the festival culture of Trinidad and Tobago and the Caribbean with the dominantly white British and European population of Toronto and to educate Canadians. The event celebrates the emancipation of Black people from slavery through Calypso music, dance, and masquerade and provided an opportunity for Caribbean communities to have a voice in the Canadian focus on multiculturalism during the 1970s. Today the <a href="https://www.torontocarnival.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Toronto Caribbean Carnival</a> is an annual event, the largest of its kind in North America.</p>

<p>Born in San Fernando, Trinidad, Shah moved to Canada in 1965 to pursue a career in petroleum engineering. He eventually left this profession to focus on carnival arts, designing and making costumes, managing mas bands, and taking a leadership role in programming from the first festival held in 1967 until his death in 2002.</p>



<p>Kenneth Shah’s archives were gathered after his passing by the late Professor Christopher Innes, a Canada Research Chair in Theatre and Performance at York University, initially deposited with York University’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.yorku.ca/research/tubman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harriet Tubman Institute&nbsp;</a>for Research on African and its Diasporas.</p>



<p>The Kenneth Shah archives, also known as a fonds, were transferred to York University Libraries in 2019. These documents consist of almost four metres of textual records, 4,000 photographs of festivals in Toronto, Montreal, New York, and Trinidad, and 51 sound and moving image recordings. They include meeting minutes and financial records for the Caribbean Cultural Committee (early organizers of the festival), correspondence with participants and other Caribbean festivals, Shah’s sketches for parade costume designs and his program proposals, regulations and registrations for band competitions, brochures, and coverage of the festival by Black community newspapers.</p>



<p>University Archivist Michael Moir says the records are very rare in the context of Carnival arts, immigration and multiculturalism, and are remarkable as the result of Kenneth Shah’s decision to include the roles of observer and recorder with those of festival organizer and participant.</p>



<p>“These records are now available for research, providing a rare opportunity to bring life to a generation of Black performers who connected with large international and multicultural audiences drawn to Toronto by its Caribbean festival,” says Moir.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">&nbsp;"As an archivist, sorting through material that encapsulates the activities and achievements of someone's life is a privilege. In Shah's archives I found reflected the importance and value of his community. Shah's love for costume arts, the Toronto Caribbean Carnival and his joy in having the opportunity to share it with others is palpable. It provides a unique insight into the Caribbean Carnival in its earliest years, as a gift from the Caribbean people to share their culture with others."</p>

<p>Access to the Kenneth Shah fonds reconnects the Trinbagonian and Caribbean diaspora in Toronto and on both sides of the Atlantic with the festival in its heyday when the parade dominated the city’s downtown. The documents preserve the legacy of Black artists who found self-expression through carnival to celebrate the abolition of slavery.</p>

<p>Moir says in his conversations with students and Markham African Caribbean Canadian Association, he found there was an increasing interest in Toronto’s Caribbean festival and its place in understanding the heritage of this diaspora. The community-based group in Markham passes down the traditions the traditions of carnival and mas bands from older to younger generations.</p>



<p>“The Kenneth Shah fonds can play an important role in this process by providing unique insights into the celebrations of the Caribbean diaspora whose experiences and culture have yet to see broader representation in public libraries and archives,” says Moir.</p>



<p><strong>Importance of Archives</strong></p>



<p>Archives are often regarded as witnesses to history. They provide a window into how people lived, entertained, connected with their culture, how and when they expressed their passion for this culture and how it changed society as a whole. Archives also help us to reflect on a history of events and to learn from them. York University Libraries is well known for its community engaged archives and community outreach partnerships and its contributions to advancing the <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/unsdgs/">UN Sustainable Development Goals</a> including its role in strengthening efforts to protect and safeguard the world’s cultural heritage. The importance of preserving community heritage and providing avenues for the community to tell its story is the cornerstone of its endeavours.</p>

And if you forget about a request, Omni will send you an email when it arrives.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How do I make a request in Omni?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>To request interlibrary loans from Omni, simply log into <a href="https://ocul-yor.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/account?vid=01OCUL_YOR:YOR_DEFAULT&amp;section=overview&amp;lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">My Account</a> and if an item is not available from York University Libraries, click the “Get it from another library” link displayed on the Omni record.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading mb-0">Making Learning Universally Accessible</h2>



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/ask-services/accessibility-services/">Library Accessibility Services </a>and the Adaptive Lab at York University’s Scott Library is continually enhancing its service of providing students with print disabilities, access to texts and information that they otherwise would not be able to read.</p>



<p class="text-uppercase"></p>
</div></div>
</div></div>



<p>For many university students, conducting deadline-driven research for multiple courses and subsequent essays or assignments can be a juggle. It can be even more daunting for those with a visual impairment, or any other print disability. A print disability, which affects approximately 10 per cent of all Canadians, is a learning, physical or visual disability that prevents a person from reading conventional print. This disability can impact a student’s ability to obtain information from texts or utilize books and other written materials critical for their academic work and success.</p>



<p>For decades now, Library Accessibility Services and the Adaptive Lab at York University’s Scott Library has continually enhanced its service of providing students with print disabilities, access to texts and information that they otherwise would not be able to read.</p>



<p>“A student with a print disability should have access to the same resources as their peers and not just what is already available in electronic format,” says Claudio Iacoe, transcription coordinator Library Accessibility Services (LAS). “LAS is set up as a dedicated unit to offer support and acts as the production house for processing scans of sources that cannot be obtained via publishers or other electronic text repositories.”</p>



<p>The LAS team can procure new hard copies via Acquisitions if required and scan items within a short turnaround time which is critical for students enrolled in their eight or more courses for their degree programs. Registered users are assigned to transcription assistants who typically work with the student throughout their entire time at York.</p>



<i class="fas fa-quote-left h1 text-primary"></i>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">“This one-on-one model offers referred students more personalized assistance if required, as well as continuity with the support,” says Iacoe. “The unit liaises closely with counsellors from Student Accessibility Services (SAS) and staff from the Assistive Technology Lab, in the Dahdaleh building and offering specific training on assistive software and hardware.”</p>

<p><br></p>



<p>With a team of just four staff, Iacoe, says the YUL accessibility services team has made a significant impact. To date, there are currently close to 700 active users at York receiving alternate formats of texts or requiring access to the adaptive lab in Scott Library. In the Fall/Winter 2022-2023 term alone, the unit supported close to 400 users on alternate format requests. Each of these users will return for each term of their four or more years and the unit will see additional students every year as new students are admitted to York University.</p>

<p>“Every year during convocation season, our Library Accessibility Services receives flowers and touching thank you cards from various students who benefitted from our services,” says Joy Kirchner, Dean of Libraries. “The appreciative notes usually say that the individual could not have graduated without our services and the kind attention of our team provided them. This wonderful team are truly making a difference to student success."</p>



<p>Iacoe has a passion for working with digitization technology and became interested in how material could be used with text-to-speech applications when he first began his role at LAS 17 years ago. Since that time, he has not only witnessed an increase in the demand for the Libraries’ accessibility services but has also seen a greater awareness about accessibility and more supports available at York broadly.</p>

<p>“When I started at the Libraries, providing alternate format readings for example was seen as the responsibility solely of one office,” says Iacoe. “Currently supports are more extensive and there is greater cooperation with departments across the university including faculty, technical supports, online publishing, etc. to address any issues with accessibility as a standard practice rather than wait for an individual to bring attention to what may be lacking.”</p>



<p>The Adaptive Lab also features computer programs such as Kurzweil, Dragon Naturally Speaking and ZoomText. These technologies can read text out loud, create written documents using dictation and zoom or enlarge everything on a computer screen. The various software makes text accessible for people who have print disabilities and otherwise would not be able to have access to the information.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-york-red-dark-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size">"I think York University Libraries goes above and beyond with regards to the number of requests we receive and service, particularly from graduate students,” says Iacoe. “I believe our ability to secure a digital edition of any source from the library collection and not just required and recommended texts, is what sets us apart from other universities. In recent years LAS has acquired accounts for several e-text repositories greatly expanding quick access to digital material.” </p>

<p>In 2011, the LAS team spearheaded the creation of Papyrus, a database software created in-house at York U Libraries. This database is used to deliver electronic files to students immediately once they are processed or secured from publishers. LAS archives the in-house scans and can make these available to multiple students if necessary. Papyrus allows for efficient file delivery as well as archiving of all secured and in-house processed material.</p>

<p>Since its launch over a decade ago, close to 3000 students or faculty have been referred to the service and to date, the database now contains 20,769 items. Students have access to any assigned material in their individual profile for the duration of the term. Papyrus archives all readings, registered student data, acquisition requests and metadata on courses users are enrolled in. A daily information feed from Student Accessibility Services imports new student referral records with counsellor and contact details to ensure LAS is always up to date regarding new students. LAS staff also have access to a complete audit trail of assigned materials and student activity to ensure a seamless process. 38 per cent of all materials archived have been made available to multiple users over the years.</p>



<p>"Papyrus has helped me greatly at succeeding in the courses which depend heavily on textbooks. I can use Kurzweil and listen to the textbook audio makes my studying more efficient,” says one student user.</p>



<p>It is no wonder that the Dean was invited to participate in the Joint ARL (Association of Research Libraries) CARL (Canadian Association of Research Libraries) Task Group Force on Marrakesh Treaty Implementation. York University Libraries quickly became a recognized as a leading partner on the international task group to advance the implementation of the Treaty between the United States and Canada in the first pilot. It became clear through this work that York's Library Accessibility Services are regarded as an international leader in library services for those needing alternate formats of texts or those who require access to the Libraries adaptive lab to utilize assistive spaces and technologies to conduct research, course work or to study.</p>



<p>The task group, representing all major University libraries in Canada and the United States, is working through several pilot collaborations to inform the implementation of global sharing of content to support students and faculty who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise have a print disability. In 2023, York University Libraries led focus groups with York students who make use of the Libraries Accessibility Services, leading to the Task Group to consider an advocacy plan to advance global sharing of content to support those with print disabilities.</p>



<p>Iacoe says it’s the student connection and the one-on-one work, that is above all else a strong source of pride for his team. LAS staff become an integral part of a student’s academic years at York University, and their gratitude has left an impact.</p>



<p>“I had one student that was visually impaired who graduated and set up his own law firm and every once in a while, I still hear from him,” says Iacoe. “You really don’t realize something so simple as providing an alternate format and just leveling the playing field so that they have access to it can make such an impact. It’s pretty rewarding.”</p>

<p class="text-uppercase mb-0">Open Educational Resources Survey </p>



<h2 class="mb-0 wp-block-heading"><em>Despite high adoption rates of OER amongst faculty respondents, survey finds lack of awareness around best practices for finding resources</em>&nbsp;</h2>



<p></p>



<p></p>
</div></div>
</div></div>



<p>According to a recent faculty survey which looked at the use of open educational resources (OER) at York University, the majority of faculty respondents are highly engaged with OER. Open educational resources are free to use and openly licensed teaching and learning materials. These can include textbooks, course reading lists, assignments, case studies, lectures and other forms of learning materials that have been produced by experts and educators in the field. Educational resources can also include scholarly outputs that are in the public domain and therefore also free to use as part of a course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The objective of the survey, developed and analyzed by working groups of the Open Education Steering Committee (OESC), (OESC's Communications, Guidelines and Policy Working Group), was to inform the OESC's development of programs and resources to support faculty with OER implementation. This would support reducing financial barriers for students, while improving the overall academic experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was also designed to inform pathways to advance innovative open education supports and teaching practices, including an inventory of campus activities in this space as well as professional development opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Results from the survey showed that 68 per cent of respondents (from a total of 121 respondents) reported using OER in their classes and faculty were much more likely to select Google and YouTube as paths to find OER.&nbsp; Despite the high adoption numbers among respondents, there was a lack of awareness around best practices for searching for and finding OER. Nearly all respondents indicated they would find OER through Google and YouTube searches, despite the existence of curated OER repositories like eCampus Ontario’s <a href="https://openlibrary.ecampusontario.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Library</a>, and <a href="https://www.oercommons.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OER Commons</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">“The findings are very instructive. It confirmed what we instinctually already knew: that our instructors are creating open educational resources but are not categorizing these resources as OER.&nbsp; The survey will help us direct the next phase of the OESC’s work to targeted areas of OER education and awareness building, including award and recognition structures at York.”&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



<p>Will Gage, Associate Vice-President, Teaching and Learning and co-chair of the OESC, remarked that the survey respondents recognize the financial burden textbook purchasing has on students and they see OERs as an accessible and flexible alternative. </p>



<p>“OER offer York instructors an avenue to make learning more affordable for students, helping to remove some barriers to access to education. At the same time the flexibility of OER allows for customization so that instructors can ensure that course materials meet the varied and evolving needs of all of our students. Our next steps will be to work on developing pathways for faculty to find, use, licence openly, and share OER that they have created or adapted.”&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Awareness about OER among faculty</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There is a lack of faculty awareness that they are actually creating and using OER in their teaching,” said Mojgan Jadidi, associate professor, Department of Earth &amp; Space Science &amp; Engineering, Lassonde School of Engineering and OER committee member. “With a closer look, we noted that  Faculty may not realize that they do not need to use an OER to create OER. For some of our instructors, it may be helpful for them to note that the creation of repositories and pathfinders documenting OER and licensing these under a Creative Commons license are also OER in their own right and should be recognized.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The OESC feels that this finding shows that more needs to be done to provide faculty with ways to find OER. The team has identified a series of strategies such as developing a York open education common language document, promoting usage and creation of OER by running an OER mini course for faculty and exploring how OER usage and creation can be recognized in the tenure and promotion process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>OER Creation and the UN SDGs</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The survey results showed a clear correlation between OER and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) where approximately 30 per cent of respondents were creating OER aligned with SDGs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our hypothesis was that very few faculty would go beyond SDG #4, Quality Education, but we were pleasantly surprised that instructors were already seeing the connection between OER and many of the other SDGs,” said Jadidi. “We observed that those who are heavily involved in OER see the connection across multiple SDGs. Also, we noted that faculty responded very positively to the affordability, accessibility, and flexibility of OER when compared to commercial textbooks. However, there was some concern about reliability and lack of peer review.”&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-group grey-bg-block px-5 m-0 has-very-light-gray-background-color has-background is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<p class="has-york-red-dark-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size">Around 62% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that there is&nbsp;interest at York in contributing to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and&nbsp;Cultural Organization (UNESCO) <a href="https://www.canva.com/link?target=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unesco.org%2Fen%2Fopen-educational-resources%2Fmandate&amp;design=DAFaDfBNL5I&amp;accessRole=viewer&amp;linkSource=document" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OER Mandate</a>. In contrast, only 19.7 % agreed or strongly agreed that they had created an OER that aligned with a UN SDG. Tenured&nbsp;and tenure-track faculty were much more likely to indicate that they had created an&nbsp;SDG-aligned OER.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-york-red-dark-color has-text-color"> —OER YorkU Faculty Survey</p>
</div></div>



<p>The findings showed 75 per cent of respondents were familiar with Creative Commons licenses (CC) but only 40 per cent applied CC licensing to their own work due to lack of time and familiarity with the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>OER and Evidence of Teaching Contribution</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>55 per cent of survey respondents were unsure if OER were recognized in the tenure and promotion policies of their department or faculty, but 15 per cent said OER could count toward “evidence of teaching contribution.” "Recognition as teaching contribution towards T&amp;P" was also the most commonly selected incentive to use OER, followed by "Access to expert staff" and "Grant funding."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This finding calls into question the utility of putting the time needed to adapt or create these resources. Devising clear policy around recognition is an important next step that would likely further encourage more people to explore OER in their teaching,” said Martin.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Importance of Findings and Next Steps</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The survey provided a better sense of the baseline familiarity and adoption of OER at York and helped to identify that awareness needs to be increased of how OER can be useful for instructors and provide positive benefits for students.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Costs of commercial textbooks and educational resources are not going to decrease any time soon, and OER offer an opportunity to reduce the financial burden that many of our students face. They can also make course development easier for new (or not so new) instructors, by offering a range of already tested out approaches that could be adapted for use in courses across the university. Overall, we know more than we did before – and most importantly we know what a few of our next steps can be,” said Martin.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Following the results of the survey, the York Open Education Steering Committee will now focus their efforts on examining existing campus awards across York’s faculties to determine if OER questions could be added where applicable. This would also include adding questions which ask faculty to reflect on how their work advances the UN SDGs potentially through Open Education. The Committee will also engage in a university-wide consultation process to learn more about opportunities and barriers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We believe creating opportunities for faculty to showcase their advancement of OE and SDGs in our funding and awards structure in the university allows a pathway for recognizing OE and SDGs indirectly in tenure and promotion files. This can hopefully lead to greater recognition of advancing OE amongst tenure committees overall, with the potential of more formalized integration into the teaching process more broadly across campus,” said Jadidi.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whether you come to York U libraries to work or study, finding the right spot is key.  Need to work with a partner or a group or just need some quiet space? No problem. Whether you study best in silence or in study nook with groups, our libraries have you covered. From Scott Library near Central Square to Bronfman Library at Schulich, to Steacie Library in the Science building and on Glendon campus with the scenic views at Frost, there are plenty of study spaces for all your needs. We asked our students to share their favourite spots. Our York U Libraries' peer mentor students, Taylor Wulf, Mila Sushkova, Musaddiq Ahmed, Timi Akinbaleye, Guillaume Jean and Subhay Anwar, share their favourite study areas. </p>



<p>Here’s what they had to say:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best place to get serious studying done</h2>



<p><strong>Taylor:</strong> If I need to get some serious studying done for finals, I like to go to Bronfman library on the 2nd floor because it is a quiet space and I'm able to get a lot done there.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-01-at-11.13.28-AM.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="678" src="https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-01-at-11.13.28-AM-1024x678.png" alt="phot of Bronfman library study space" class="wp-image-23740" srcset="https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-01-at-11.13.28-AM-1024x678.png 1024w, https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-01-at-11.13.28-AM-300x199.png 300w, https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-01-at-11.13.28-AM.png 1095w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bronfman Library</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Musaddiq:</strong> 4th / 5th floors of Scott Library. The pin drop silence with practically zero distractions, helps me get my stuff done with full focus</p>



<p><strong>Timi:</strong> My favourite study space during exams is Steacie because it is very quiet during exam time.</p>



<p><strong>Guillaume:</strong> At Frost, I like the individual study stations along the windows on the second floor. The partitions provide some privacy that block any distractions while having a stunning view of the manor and the rose garden.</p>

</div>



<p><strong>Mila:</strong> Bronfman library, it's really quiet but also has a lot of natural lighting so you don't end up feeling sleepy and can focus properly. There are also tables with lighting and then smaller individual study spots so plenty to choose from.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best place to relax</h2>



<p><strong>Taylor:</strong> My favorite study space to relax is in the Bronfman Library lounge because the chairs are comfortable and there is a nice view.</p>



<p><strong>Musaddiq: </strong>Marsden Salon. The space has cozy environment, comfortable furnishings and great wall art.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p><strong>Mila: </strong>Scott library, study spaces on the balconies - can talk at a normal volume, can simply sit on the floor, not necessarily at the study carrels</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SCott-desks-.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SCott-desks--1024x679.png" alt="" class="wp-image-23725" width="613" height="406" srcset="https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SCott-desks--1024x679.png 1024w, https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SCott-desks--300x199.png 300w, https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SCott-desks-.png 1032w" sizes="(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Scott Library 5th floor</figcaption></figure></div>


<p><strong>Timi: </strong>Marsden Salon, this is because it is a small area where I can relax on the couch<br></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best place for group projects or group studying</h2>



<p><strong>Taylor:</strong> If I have a group project, I like to book the group rooms at either Bronfman or Steacie library because they are more enclosed and less prone to noise distractions than the ones in Scott.</p>



<p><strong>Mila: </strong>Scott library 2nd floor - not fully expected to be quiet, can comfortably chat, usually plenty of space where you can sit together if needed.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><a href="https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/library_commons-724x483-3-edited-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/library_commons-724x483-3-edited-1.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-23698" width="1087" height="612" srcset="https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/library_commons-724x483-3-edited-1.jpeg 723w, https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/library_commons-724x483-3-edited-1-300x169.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1087px) 100vw, 1087px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Collaboratory at Scott Library</figcaption></figure></div>


<p><strong>Musaddiq: </strong>Collaboratory. It's spacious, has ample natural light and is very happening place which gets you going too!<br><strong>Guillaume: </strong>At Frost, the study rooms are ideal for group work. They provide an enclosed space where we can talk, put our ideas on the board or connect our laptop to the screen.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best place to work when you have a break in your schedule</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><a href="https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-01-at-12.33.09-PM.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-01-at-12.33.09-PM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-23762" width="359" height="237" srcset="https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-01-at-12.33.09-PM.png 936w, https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-01-at-12.33.09-PM-300x198.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Maps Library study area</figcaption></figure></div>


<p><strong>Taylor:</strong> When I have to do work between classes, I like to go to the back area of the first floor of Scott Library because not many people go back there. It's nice to have "your own" space to get things done.</p>



<p><strong>Mila:</strong> Scott library, it's in the center and close to where all my classes are, and I can usually find a table to sit at and do some reading.</p>



<p><strong>Musaddiq: </strong>Scott's Maps Library. It's nice, quiet and really close to my lecture halls.</p>



<p><strong>Guillaume:</strong> At Frost, I usually go work in the Reference Room. I like the atmosphere with the floor to ceiling bookshelves that remind me of an old library.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best place for quiet space to work with a partner</h2>



<p><strong>Musaddiq:</strong> Group Study Rooms are ideal to work with partner in quiet place. It is private conversation friendly space so you can collaborate without any hassle.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><a href="https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-27-at-11.21.44-AM.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-27-at-11.21.44-AM-1024x678.png" alt="" class="wp-image-23616" width="417" height="274" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bronfman Library Study Room</figcaption></figure></div>


<p><strong>Taylor: </strong>If I need a quiet space to do work with a partner, I like to use the Steacie or Bronfman group rooms for the same reasons stated above.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-01-at-10.28.12-AM.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="513" height="338" src="https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-01-at-10.28.12-AM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-23727" srcset="https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-01-at-10.28.12-AM.png 513w, https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-01-at-10.28.12-AM-300x198.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 513px) 100vw, 513px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Scott Libary Study Room</figcaption></figure></div>


<p><strong>Subhay:</strong> Scott study rooms are the best place to work with a partner because they know the location and it's easier to book with longer open times so it can be accessed in late hours after everyone's classes.</p>



<p><br><strong>Mila:</strong> Bronfman/Scott study rooms - quiet enough but can still talk if needed and also private enough that you don't have to worry about others overhearing your conversations</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Favourite Hidden Gems at York U Libraries</h2>



<p><strong>Taylor:</strong> My "hidden gem" place at the libraries would be the back-most cubicle space on the second floor of Bronfman Library. There is a nice view from the window, and there are fewer noise distractions than on the first floor.</p>



<p><strong>Musaddiq:</strong> Micro-reader room. The place is usually empty and so is basically your own private group study room that you do not have to book beforehand.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Untitled-design.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Untitled-design-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-23737" srcset="https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Untitled-design-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Untitled-design-300x169.png 300w, https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Untitled-design.png 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Left to Right: Scott Library Microtext Room and Maps Library</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Subhay:</strong> 5th floor balcony study area which is not too quiet but quiet enough for you to work with a partner in relative silence and focus.<br>Mila: It wouldn't be a hidden gem otherwise (4th floor at Scott - it's super quiet and, if I'm not mistaken, also where the Loeb Classics editions are (call number is PA, I just forget which floor that is). I like to choose a study table, grab a couple off the shelf and flip through them.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Collaboration between York U Libraries and a fourth-year public history course is helping students to produce web profiles via Wikimedia platforms—all in an effort to change the way Black histories are being shared online.</p>

<p class="has-york-red-dark-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><em>York U librarians and archivists provide expertise to fourth-year History students on new ways of learning and engaging with sources for Wikipedia and Wikidata</em></p>



<p>At a time when the rate of the creation and sharing of information is rapidly increasing and contributing to disinformation, librarians and teaching faculty in postsecondary institutions are finding new ways to incorporate information literacy into their instructional goals.<br>Now, a new collaboration between York U Libraries and a fourth-year public history course in the <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/laps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Faculty of Liberal Arts &amp; Professional Studies (LA&amp;PS)</a>, is helping students conduct well-sourced research to produce web profiles via Wikimedia platforms—all in an effort to change the way Black histories are being shared online.</p>



<p><br>This year, York U Libraries supported the placement of two students from <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/laps/hist/course-description/ap-hist-4840-6-0-public-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HIST4840</a>, taught by Jennifer Bonnell, associate professor in the Department of History at York University, where they worked as research assistants at the libraries and during the Black Histories Wikipedia and Wikidata Edit-a-thon, a collaboration between York University, University of Toronto, Toronto Metropolitan University and the Toronto Public Library.</p>



<i class="fas fa-quote-left h1 text-primary"></i>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">“This year’s addition of the Black Histories Edit-a-thon project has provided a great opportunity for my students to be involved in a real-time, crowd-sourced method of making historical sources from marginalized groups more accessible to researchers and the interested public,” said Bonnell. “The project offered an opportunity for hands-on work to bring Black history to wider audiences and my students have gained transferable skills in working with digital scholarship applications, event planning and facilitation.”</p>

<p>This year’s placement provided a unique way for librarians and archivists to not only provide expertise but help culminate the students’ learning in an annual multi-university event.</p>



<p><br>“For us at York U libraries, our librarians and archivists are able to share our deep knowledge of our collections and resources with our students and communities,” said Alexandra Wong, Data Visualization and Analytics Librarian, Open Scholarship Department. “We also bring our vast experience with working with primary, secondary, and tertiary sources and how to use those sources for citations in Wikipedia and Wikidata to create a better system where the sum of all knowledge is well sourced.”</p>



<p><br>During this placement, students, Leena Hussein and Alanna Brown are learning how organizations like galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAM) are contributing to the public record and students learned how to write for public audiences. This includes how to edit and create Wikipedia articles and Wikidata items using sources from York University Libraries to celebrate Black histories.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group grey-bg-block px-5 m-0 has-very-light-gray-background-color has-background is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<p class="has-york-red-dark-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size">"Growing up in Canada our education system for Black history stops at the Underground Railroad and there’s so much more to Black history than that, it includes stories of Black excellence, Black agency, and Black joy, so I find that joining this placement is very important in the sense that I’m helping to bring more information to Black history that’s outside of Black struggle and enslavement." </p>



<p class="has-york-red-dark-color has-text-color"> —Alanna Brown, fourth-year History student, Faculty of Liberal Arts &amp; Professional Studies (LA&amp;PS), York University.</p>
</div></div>



<p>Students also further engage with the network of academic and public libraries to support the collaborative effort of the Black History Edit-a-thon, which includes co-creating editing topics, public outreach, and helping to facilitate the Edit-a-thon. The edit-a-thon also brings together a group of interdisciplinary scholars and students to improve the coverage and quality of Black content online through weekly synchronous sessions.</p>



<p>Professor Bonnell says unique experiences like the Black History edit-a-thon can have an impact in more than just their education in the course.</p>



<p>“Projects like this often play an important role in shaping their choices for future careers and next steps beyond graduation,” said Bonnell. “An opportunity to work closely with library staff and to learn about the career pathways and training that staff pursued helps students to make career choices of their own. Placements like this become the first step in developing a professional network they can choose to carry with them into graduate study and future career opportunities.”</p>



<p>Hussein agrees.</p>



<p><br>“What I've learned through this program has much to do with tangible skills, such as editing for example, and understanding how software in these databases is run,” says Hussein, a fourth-year history student. “I’ve also learned intangible skills such as understanding how biases are created in media and in these platforms. I found that in having this knowledge, I'm much better able to understand why things are the way they are and how I as an individual can help to make things better.”</p>



<p>The students gained familiarity and appreciation for open knowledge and metadata, learned how they influence the public’s interaction with history, and the slow and careful labour involved with producing open knowledge on important subjects. The skills gained included working with primary and secondary sources from the <a href="https://digital.library.yorku.ca/yul-asc/clara-thomas-archives-special-collections" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clara Thomas Archives and Special Collection</a> and York University Map Library, writing for the public (non-academic writing) through Wikipedia contributions, how to structure open data for reuse, and practices to facilitate a collaborative and community-driven event.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">"I am delighted projects like this create immediate positive outcomes and experiences for students who are gaining excellent experiences participating in publishing projects. Libraries for some time now have provided publishing experience for our students from more traditional platforms such as books and journals that we manage and host to newer models of publishing such as this wikimedia project. Each publishing output brings unique considerations that students are exposed to and must think through in order to participate. This uniquely aligns with York University Libraries prioritizing UNSDG goals.”</p>



<p> — Joy Kirchner, Dean of York University Libraries.</p>



<p class="small"></p>



<p>“It's just been very surreal to be able to create and just know that I'm making some sort of difference,” said Hussein, who was inspired by her experience and now applying to a Masters of Library Science program.</p>



<p>“For faculty like me, collaborations with YorkU librarians are enormously valuable: librarians and archivists can offer hands-on training for students in archival research and digital scholarship applications,” said Bonnell. “The workshops they offer in these areas have been valuable to my undergraduate and graduate students, and they help me as a researcher keep up to date on digital applications that can aid my research and its dissemination. In short, they offer immersive experiences and training in practical research and research dissemination technologies beyond what I can offer in the classroom. They are a vital partner in equipping our students for a rapidly changing career landscape.”<br></p>
