York University Libraries provide support and infrastructure for scholarly production and dissemination. At the production end, we offer open access publishing support, research data management assistance, and a free online journal hosting service called York Digital Journals. Limited financial aid in support of open access publishing is offered via an Open Access Author Fund, and YorkSpace, York University's institutional repository supports an alternate route to open access which involves placing a copy of your published work (subject to publisher policy) in an open access repository.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Making one\u2019s publications accessible is a function of a number of factors, including addressing barriers to access (open access publishing), considering copyright, leveraging technological infrastructure to maximize visibility, and publishing in venues that are recognized and visible to one\u2019s target readership. The links below address these areas, integrating how the infrastructure described above advances strategies for navigating the landscape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.library.yorku.ca\/web\/research\/oapublishing\/york-university-senate-policy-on-open-access\/\">York University Senate Policy on Open Access: Frequently Asked Questions<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.library.yorku.ca\/web\/publishoa\/\">Understanding green and gold open access publishing<\/a>&nbsp;(includes how to meet Tri-Council open access requirements)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.carl-abrc.ca\/advancing-research\/scholarly-communication\/info-for-authors\/\">Copyright information for authors<\/a>&nbsp;(includes copyright, author addenda, takedown notices)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.library.yorku.ca\/web\/research\/visibility\/\">Ways to maximize the indexing, visibility and exposure of your research using YorkSpace<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/library.yorku.ca\/web\/research\/rdm\/\">Research data management<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.library.yorku.ca\/web\/research-metrics\/\">Research impact<\/a> (includes research metrics, altmetrics, benchmarking, visualization tools) <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Need help with making your research open access?&nbsp;<\/strong>Contact us at&nbsp;<a href=\"&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#x6f;&#x70;&#x65;&#x6e;&#x64;&#x65;&#x70;&#x6f;&#x73;&#x69;&#x74;&#x40;&#x79;&#x6f;&#x72;&#107;&#117;&#46;&#99;&#97;\">op&#101;&#x6e;&#x64;&#x65;pos&#105;&#x74;&#x40;&#x79;or&#107;&#117;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x61;<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Author Profiles and Identifiers (ORCID, Scopus ID, Web of Science ResearcherID<\/strong>)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Author profiles, also known as researcher profiles, are an essential component of your academic career to build and enhance your online presence and increase engagement. An author profile is an accessible online profile of your professional and academic activities, outputs, and achievements. It allows information about your academic and professional career, and your research to be correctly attributed to you, visible, easy to find, and accessible.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several types of author profiles that can be created and managed. Of note, some profiles are automatically created once you have an article that is indexed, notably the Scopus database. An author profile contains a unique author or researcher identifier that is assigned to you and follows you over the course of your academic and professional career. Much like a Social Security Number (SIN), unique author identifiers like ORCID, Scopus ID, and Web of Science ResearcherID allow researchers to distinguish themselves, even if names, employment, and affiliations change. It is important to check and correct your author profiles, because your publications may be fragmented with multiple IDs that have been created by different profiling platforms. Enhance your visibility by creating and monitoring author profiles over time. Learn how to correct your author details, add your institutional affiliation, merge author profiles, and ensure your publications are correctly attributed to you:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Create and update your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.library.yorku.ca\/web\/research-metrics\/orcid\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ORCID profile<\/a> &nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Check and update your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.library.yorku.ca\/web\/scopusid\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Scopus author profile<\/a> &nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create and update your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.library.yorku.ca\/web\/wosresearcherid\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Web of Science author profile<\/a> \u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Contact\u00a0<a href=\"&#x6d;&#x61;il&#x74;&#x6f;&#58;me&#x74;&#x72;&#105;cs&#x40;&#x79;&#111;rk&#x75;&#x2e;ca\">&#x6d;&#x65;&#x74;&#x72;&#105;cs&#64;y&#x6f;&#x72;&#x6b;&#x75;&#46;ca<\/a> for more information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.library.yorku.ca\/web\/research\/oapublishing\/\">Open Access Publishing<\/a><\/strong> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>York University Libraries have directed a small portion of their collections budget in support of an open access author fund to cover author processing charges for York researchers who wish to publish their work in open access journals.
