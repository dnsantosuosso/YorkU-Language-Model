At this point, students must choose a major, but subsequent changes are possible. In selecting courses, students who are undecided should try to take introductory courses in a number of potential major subjects. This will allow them to proceed in their subject of choice without the possibility of a delay. Some departments will not permit undecided majors to enrol in their courses.</p>

Combined program require careful planning and may take longer than four years, and/or move than 120 credits to complete.</p>

<p>A program involving a first major in the other Faculty and a major or minor in the Faculty of Science lead to an Honours BA, BES, BFA or BSc degree in the other Faculty.</p>

<p>For a list of possible subject combinations, refer to the sections above. For details of the major or minor requirements for each program in the Faculty of Science, refer to the Faculty of Science Programs of Study section. For details of the major or minor requirements in the other Faculty, refer to the Programs of Study section of the appropriate Faculty.</p>

<h5>Science and Education</h5>

<p>A student wishing to obtain the professional certification required to teach in Ontario schools may take both teacher training and an undergraduate academic program concurrently. This does not shorten the time required to gain the qualification but provides a better chance for the student to relate theory and practice and to have more opportunity to gain practical experience than is possible in a one-year program.</p>

<p>A student in the Faculty of Science who is presently enrolled in first year (at least 24 credits) or has a minimum of 36 credits remaining in the BSc, Honours BSc, BA or Honours BA with an overall standing of at least 5.00 (C+) may apply to coregister in the Faculty of Education. A coregistered student normally takes one and a half or two full courses in the Faculty of Education in an academic year concurrent with courses for the BSc, Honours BSc, BA or Honours BA. The specific study program of each student is subject to the approval of both Faculties.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion of the course requirements for the degree in the Faculty of Science, and of the required education courses, a coregistered student is awarded a BSc, Honours BSc, BA or Honours BA and a BEd.</p>

<h4>Certificate Programs</h4>

<p>There are numerous certificate programs offered by York University in various subject areas, allowing recognition of a specialised area of study. Certificate programs are open to all undergraduate students, subject to student eligibility and course availability. The following certificates may be of interest to students taking programs in the Faculty of Science.</p>

<h5>Actuarial Science</h5>

<p>This certificate is offered by the Department of Mathematics and Statistics of the Faculty of Science. York University students may earn a certificate in Acturial Science concurrently with fulfillment of the requirements for a Bachelors degree. This certificate is also available as a stand alone Certificate for students who already hold a Bachelors degree from an accredited institution, who are admissible according to Faculty and University policies, and whose previous studies satisfy the Certificate's admission requirements. For details of the certificate requirements, including the certificate's admission requirements, refer to the Faculty of Science Programs of Study section.</p>

<h5>Certificate in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing</h5>

<p>This certificate is offered jointly by the Department of Earth and Space Science and Engineering of the Lassonde School of Engineering, the Department of Geography of the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies and the Faculty of Environmental Studies.</p>

<p>The certificate program includes three streams, one offered through each of the three units above. Honours BSc or BSc candidates majoring in environmental science or geography may be particularly interested in this certificate.</p>

<p>For additional information, consult the three units mentioned above.</p>

<h5>Certificate in Meteorology</h5>

<p>This certificate is offered by the Department of Earth and Space Science and Engineering, Lassonde School of Engineering. The program is open to any student who satisfies the program admission requirements.

<p>Note that percentages are not part of the official grading scheme and are only to be used as guidelines. The letter-grade system is the fundamental system of assessment of performance in undergraduate programs at York University. Note also that grades submitted by an instructor are subject to review by the teaching unit in which the course is offered and by the Faculty Council through its Committee on Examinations and Academic Standards. Grades appear on grade reports and transcripts as soon as they are submitted to the Registrar’s Office and are not official until they have been reviewed and approved. Final course grades may be adjusted to conform to program or Faculty grades-distribution profiles.</p>

            <div><h4>Bachelor Programs</h4>

<p><strong>To graduate in a bachelor program.</strong>&nbsp;A minimum overall grade point average of 4.00 (C) is required in order to be eligible to graduate in an undergraduate bachelor program.</p>

<p>Students in a bachelor program who have passed 90 credits in accordance with Faculty and program requirements, but whose cumulative overall grade point average is below 4.00 (C), may attempt to raise their average by taking up to 12 additional credits, to a maximum of 102 credits. These courses must be above the 1000 level and must be taken at York University. Regulations on equivalent and excluded courses apply.</p>

<h4>Honours Programs</h4>

<p>Honours students are classified by year according to the number of credits they have obtained (see below):</p>

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>YEAR</th>
			<th>CREDITS</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>Fewer than 24</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>Fewer than 54</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>3</td>
			<td>Fewer than 84</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>4</td>
			<td>At least 84</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Subject to the selection criteria of the major departments, students will be registered in the Honours program who, upon completion of each academic session, have a cumulative average as follows:</p>

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>YEAR</th>
			<th>CUMULATIVE OVERALL AVERAGE</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>4.00</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>4.25</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>3</td>
			<td>4.80</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>4</td>
			<td>5.00</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Students who have taken 84 credits, and who wish to proceed in an Honours program must have a cumulative grade point average of 5.00 overall.</p>

<p>To graduate in an Honours program requires successful completion of all Faculty requirements and departmental required courses and a minimum cumulative credit-weighted grade point average of 5.00 (C+) over all courses completed, subject to the exception.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;some programs may require a higher standard – consult the program of study requirements in the Faculty of Science Programs of Study section.</p>

<ol start="1">
	<li>those who hold an undergraduate degree (three-year bachelor’s degree minimum) from an accredited university/university-level institution;</li>
	<li>those who do not hold an undergraduate degree but wish to enrol in York courses to fulfill the academic, upgrading or professional development requirements of a professional designation;</li>
	<li>those who are currently attending another recognized university and wish to take York courses on a letter of permission issued by their home institution.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement</h4>

<p>Students in categories a) and b) whose overall cumulative grade point average (OCGPA) falls below 4.00 on at least 24 credits attempted will not be allowed to enrol in any subsequent session as visiting students. Students who are not permitted to re-enrol must apply for re-admission through the Admissions Office.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;repeated course legislation does not apply to visiting students but only to academic degrees and certificates. Therefore, all courses attempted or taken will count in the OCGPA.</p>

<h4>Credit Limits</h4>

<p>Students in category b) who have maintained on OCGPA of 4.00 throughout their studies and who have completed 30 credits will not be allowed to enrol in subsequent sessions and must either reactivate to proceed as visiting students or may choose to apply for admission to a degree or certificate program.</p>

There is no provision for rewriting a final examination to improve a grade.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the student to ensure that full documentation (medical or other) is provided in support of requests for deferred standing or aegrotat standing. A request submitted on the grounds of illness must include the attending physician’s statement form completed by the petitioner’s physician. Appropriate forms and guidelines are available from the Deferred Standing webpage at&nbsp;<a href="https://myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/deferred-standing" title="http://myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/deferred-standing">myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/deferred-standing</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Deferred standing agreement.</strong>&nbsp;In the Faculty of Science, deferred standing may be arranged with the course director by means of a form called a deferred standing agreement (DSA). The DSA form and supporting documentation must normally be submitted within one week following a missed examination or the last day to submit course work.</p>

<p><strong>Deferred standing petition.</strong>&nbsp;A petition for deferred standing may be submitted if the course director indicates on the DSA form a refusal to approve deferred standing. The petition application, together with other written evidence to be taken into consideration, must normally be submitted to the Registrar’s Office within one week following a missed examination or the last day to submit coursework.</p>

<p><strong>Aegrotat standing petition.</strong>&nbsp;In exceptional circumstances, a petition for aegrotat standing may be submitted in cases where a student cannot be expected to complete coursework. If granted, the phrase AEG (“aegrotat standing” from the Latin for “she/he is ill”) is substituted for the grade on the transcript. Aegrotat standing is seldom granted in respect of final examinations; instead, the student may be granted permission to write deferred examination(s).</p>

The weighting is set by the course director and must be announced and available in writing within the first two weeks of classes. If possible, information about assignments, marking schemes and evaluation should be made known to students at or before the first class meeting. A previously announced marking scheme for a course may be changed by the course director with the consent of students enrolled in the course; the new marking scheme must also be distributed in written form.</p>

<p>Prior to the final date to withdraw from a course without receiving a grade, graded feedback worth at least 15 per cent of the final grade for fall, winter or summer term and 30 per cent for 'full year' courses offered in the fall/winter session must be received by students in all courses (excepting the following: those senior undergraduate courses, such as honours theses, where course work consists of a single piece of work, practicum courses, ungraded courses, courses in Faculties where the drop date occurs within the first three weeks of classes, courses which run on a compressed schedule). Students who, in the absence of recognized extenuating circumstances, fail to complete such course work cannot use the lack of feedback as grounds for withdrawal.</p>

<p>No examinations or tests collectively worth more than 20 per cent of the final grade in a course will be given during the final 14 calendar days of classes in a term. The exceptions to the rule are classes which regularly meet Friday evenings or on Saturday and/or Sunday at any time, and courses offered on a compressed schedule.</p>

<p>All tests in a given section of a course must be given during the class or tutorial times listed in the lecture schedule for that section of the course. The only exception is the scheduling of common tests administered to multiple-section courses; in such cases students with a conflict must be given reasonable accommodation.</p>

<p>Term work in any course may not be submitted later than the first day of the final examination period for the course. Earlier final dates for the submission of term work may be set at the discretion of the department/division concerned.</p>

	<li><strong>Grade point average below 2.50:</strong>&nbsp;students whose cumulative grade point average on at least 24 credits is below 2.50 must withdraw for 12 months.</li>
	<li><strong>Students whose grade point average is below 4.00 and equal to or greater than 2.50:</strong>&nbsp;students who have received an academic warning for a cumulative grade point average below 4.00 must satisfy the academic warning conditions as specified above or be required to withdraw for 12 months.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Reactivation After Required Withdrawal</h4>

<p>Students who have been required to withdraw may apply for reactivation after the requisite period of absence by submitting a request at the Reactivation Web page at&nbsp;<a href="https://registrar.yorku.ca/enrol/reactivate" title="http://registrar.yorku.ca/enrol/reactivate">registrar.yorku.ca/enrol/reactivate</a>. Students who return to their studies after such a required withdrawal (as well as those who have been allowed to continue their studies by virtue of a petition to the Petitions Committee) receive a debarment warning.</p>

<h4>Debarment Warning</h4>

<p>Students who have been required to withdraw in the Faculty of Science, or the equivalent in another Faculty at York University or elsewhere, receive a debarment warning upon continuing their studies in the Faculty.</p>

<h4>Debarment Warning Conditions</h4>

<p>Students on debarment warning must achieve a cumulative grade point average of at least 4.00 within the next 24 credits taken or earn a sessional grade point average of at least 5.00 in the session in which the 24th credit is taken and in each subsequent session until the cumulative average reaches 4.00, and must then maintain this average. Students who do not fulfil these conditions will be debarred from the University.</p>

<h4>Debarment</h4>

<p>Students who have been debarred may be re-admitted in some subsequent session only if they give convincing evidence that they can profit from university work. Applications for re-admission are not normally entertained in less than two years from the date of debarment. Applications must be submitted to the Admissions Office (<a href="https://futurestudents.yorku.ca/" title="http://futurestudents.yorku.ca">futurestudents.yorku.ca</a>). Students who are re-admitted (as well as those who have been allowed to continue their studies by virtue of a petition) receive an academic probation.</p>

<h4>Academic Probation</h4>

<p>Students who have been debarred and who subsequently resume their studies in the Faculty whether by petitioning to continue without interruption or by applying for readmission, receive an academic probation. Students on academic probation must meet the debarment warning conditions outlined above; otherwise, they will be debarred.</p>

            <div><p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;the following applies to students admitted to the Faculty for Fall 2013 and subsequent sessions. Students admitted before Fall 2013 should consult the York Undergraduate Programs Calendar of the year in which they were admitted for information regarding warnings and sanctions which apply to them.</p>

<h4>Academic Warning</h4>

<p>Students whose cumulative overall grade point average falls below 4.00 (C) at the end of any session, or who enter the Faculty with a grade point average equivalent to less than 4.00 (C) on the York scale receive an Academic Warning.</p>

<h4>Academic Warning Conditions</h4>

<p>Students on Academic Warning must achieve a cumulative overall grade point average of at least 4.00 within the next 24 credits taken, or earn a sessional grade point average of at least 5 in the session in which that 24th credit is completed and in each subsequent session until the cumulative grade point average reaches 4, or be required to withdraw.</p>

<h4>Required to Withdraw</h4>

<p>Students whose academic record shows marked weakness may be required to withdraw from their studies for one year, during which they are encouraged to identify and remedy any problems which may have contributed materially to their failure to perform to their potential, and to reflect on their reasons for pursuing a university education. The following regulations apply to Required Withdrawals:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Grade Point Average Below 2.5:</strong>&nbsp;Students whose cumulative grade point average on at least 24 York credits is below 2.5 must withdraw for 12 months.</li>
	<li><strong>Failure to satisfy Academic Warning conditions:</strong>&nbsp;Students who fail to meet the Academic Warning Conditions above will be required to withdraw.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Petition to Continue Without Interruption</h4>

<p>Students who have been required to withdraw may submit a petition to their home Faculty Petitions Committee requesting permission to continue their studies without interruption. Students granted such a petition will be allowed to continue their studies on Debarment Warning.</p>

<h4>Reactivation after Required Withdrawal</h4>

<p>Students who have been required to withdraw must apply for reactivation after the requisite period of absence by submitting a reactivation request to the Registrar’s Office. Students who return to their studies after a Required Withdrawal (as well as those who have been allowed to continue their studies by virtue of a petition to the Committee on Petitions) receive a Debarment Warning.</p>

<h4>Debarment Warning</h4>

<p>Students who have been required to withdraw receive a Debarment Warning upon continuing their studies in the University.</p>

<h4>Debarment Warning Conditions</h4>

<p>Students on Debarment Warning must achieve a cumulative overall grade point average of at least 4.00 within the next 24 credits taken or earn a sessional grade point average of at least 5 in the session in which that 24th credit is completed and in each subsequent session until the cumulative grade point average reaches 4, and must then maintain this average in order to continue.</p>

<h4>Debarment</h4>

<p>Students who fail to meet the Debarment Warning Conditions outlined above will be Debarred from the University. Debarment, the minimum period for which is normally two years, means that the student is no longer a student at York University.</p>

<h4>Petition to Continue Without Interruption</h4>

<p>Students who have been Debarred may submit a petition to their home Faculty Petitions Committee requesting permission to continue their studies without interruption. Students granted such a petition will be allowed to continue their studies on Academic Probation.</p>

            <div><p>Appeals by students and/or faculty members against rulings of the Petitions Committee and/or the Committee on Examinations and Academic Standards of the Faculty of Science (with the exception of appeals on academic honesty rulings - see below) must be filed in writing with the secretary of the appeals panel of the Executive and Planning Committee, 349 Lumbers Building, within 15 calendar days of the date of notification of the decision.</p>

<p>Appeals against rulings of the petitions committee and/or the committee on examinations and academic standing will be heard by a panel of two faculty members of the executive and planning committee and one student member selected from student members of the Faculty council. In the rare event that a decision of a panel of the executive and planning committee, or of the Senate Appeals Committee, requires a completely new (de novo) hearing, the matter will be heard by a panel of three faculty members of the executive and planning committee and one student member selected from student members of the Faculty council. These panels will be constituted, as required, from available members, by the secretary of the appeals panel.</p>

<p>Members shall disqualify themselves if they are involved as a party or witness in the case, or believe that they could not be impartial. Where members disqualify themselves, alternate members will replace them.</p>

<p>Appeals are heard only on the following grounds:</p>

<ol start="1">
	<li>new evidence, i.e. evidence that, through no fault of the appellant, could not reasonably have been presented at an earlier level (as a guide, events or performance subsequent to the decisions of the petitions committee and/or the committee on examinations and academic standing are not to be construed as new evidence);</li>
	<li>evidence of procedural irregularity in the previous consideration of the case by the petitions committee and/or the committee on examinations and academic standing. This may be understood to include actions taken by the Faculty of Science, its officers, committees or members with respect to the case which would violate or nullify any of the following:
	<ul>
		<li>normal and written procedures of the Faculty;</li>
		<li>recognized custom of the Faculty;</li>
		<li>the principles of natural justice and fairness.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Students and faculty members have the right to represent themselves at appeal hearings to hear and answer allegations and to present their arguments. Appeal hearings are not open to anyone not directly involved in the case being considered. The committee's decision is taken in camera.</p>

<p>All appeal decisions are reported in writing to the students and the faculty members concerned, the Office of Science Academic Services, the home Faculty and the Registrar’s Office.</p>

<p>Further appeals may be made to the Senate Appeals Committee. Enquiries about these appeals, and the grounds upon which they may be filed, should be directed to the Senate Secretariat, 1050 Kaneff Tower.</p>

<p>Appeals on academic honesty rulings are also made directly to the Senate Appeals Committee. Appeals are heard only on the same grounds as cited above.</p>

            <div><p>Every effort is made in the Faculty of Science to ensure that each student receives academic advice and sufficient information to guide in course selection and program choice. Within this context, the student is solely responsible for the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>ensuring that the courses chosen in consultation with an adviser meet all program (refer to the Faculty of Science Programs of Study section) and degree (refer to the Faculty of Science&nbsp;<em>Regulations Governing Undergraduate Degree Requirements</em>&nbsp;section of the&nbsp;<em>Faculty Rules</em>) requirements for graduation;</li>

	<li>fulfilling the requirements and being aware of academic progress in all registered courses;</li>
	<li>noting and abiding by the sessional deadline dates published on the Current Students webpage each year, especially course add and drop deadline dates.</li>

      </h3>	<div class="content">
		
      <div>
              <div>
            <div><p>Before each academic session begins, every student can meet with an adviser to discuss program and degree requirements. However, it is the responsibility of all students to familiarize themselves with both the requirements of their individual programs of study (refer to the Faculty of Science Programs of Study section) and the regulations governing their degree requirements (refer to the Faculty of Science&nbsp;<em>Regulations Governing Undergraduate Degree Requirements</em>&nbsp;section of the&nbsp;<em>Faculty Rules</em>).</p>

<p>In preparation for enrolment, and at the advising appointment, the following should be considered:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Choice of subject area(s).</strong>&nbsp;Every student must choose one or two subject area(s) according to personal interests and career goals.</li>
	<li><strong>Choice of program.</strong>&nbsp;All students who have completed 24 or more credits must choose a program (bachelor, Specialized Honours, Honours Major, Honours Double Major or Honours Major/Minor) in accordance with Faculty of Science regulations, including minimum grade point average requirements for Honours programs. See Faculty of Science Regulations Governing Undergraduate Degree Requirements, Faculty of Science Regulations Governing Examinations and Academic Standards (Designation of Honours or Bachelor Program section), and the program of study requirements in the Faculty of Science Programs of Study section.</li>
	<li><strong>Faculty of Science degree requirements and regulations.</strong>&nbsp;Refer to the Faculty of Science&nbsp;<em>Regulations Governing Undergraduate Degree Requirements</em>&nbsp;section of the&nbsp;<em>Faculty Rules</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Course selection at the 1000 level.</strong>&nbsp;The 1000-level (entry-level) of all programs is multidisciplinary. Course requirements are outlined under the program of study requirements for each subject area in the Faculty of Science Programs of Study section. Besides ensuring that students are well prepared for more advanced study in the subject areas of their choice these requirements ensure that students achieve an adequate and appropriate breadth in science, help students to develop basic computational, mathematical and laboratory skills, and also an appreciation of the humanities and social sciences. Most introductory courses carry prerequisites, normally at the 12U level. Unless stated otherwise in the program of study requirements Honours Double Major candidates and Honours Major/Minor candidates are expected to complete all 1000-level requirements for both majors and/or minor, excepting course credit exclusions.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Since the normal yearly full-time credit load is 30 credits, it may not be possible for the student to complete all the 1000-level requirements for any degree program in year one. It is important to complete in year one those courses that are prerequisites for required 2000- level courses or that are introductory to the major or minor subject area. It is advisable to complete as many of the other required 1000-level courses as possible in year one to avoid timetable conflicts in later years. In some circumstances, equivalent courses approved in writing by the major program(s) may be substituted for the courses listed.</li>
	<li><strong>Course selection above the 1000 level.</strong>&nbsp;Complete details of the course requirements for all subject areas and programs are found in the Faculty of Science Programs of Study section. Degree checklists for all programs/subject areas are available from the Office of Science Academic Services.</li>
	<li><strong>Prerequisites/corequisites.</strong>&nbsp;Most courses in the Faculty of Science have prerequisite and/or corequisite requirements. These may be specific courses (indicating specific required background knowledge) or they may be general prerequisites (indicating a required level of maturity in university studies in the subject area or overall). As indicated in the Faculty of Science&nbsp;<em>Regulations Governing Undergraduate Degree Requirements</em>&nbsp;section of the&nbsp;<em>Faculty Rules</em>, it is the student's responsibility to enrol in only those courses for which the student has successfully completed all designated prerequisites and to take concurrently all specified corequisites not already completed successfully. Students who lack the stated prerequisites but have reason to believe they can succeed in a course must obtain written permission from department concerned (consult the departmental undergraduate office regarding the procedure to be followed) before enrolling.</li>
	<li><strong>Course credit exclusions.</strong>&nbsp;Students should avoid enrolling in any two courses which are designated as course credit exclusions of one another, since credit will be given for only one. For more information regarding course credit exclusions, refer to Course Credit Exclusions in the Faculty of Science Regulations Governing Undergraduate Degree Requirements section.</li>
	<li><strong>Scheduling.</strong>&nbsp;All information regarding courses to be offered in each session, times, places etc. is found on the York Courses website (<a href="https://w2prod.sis.yorku.ca/Apps/WebObjects/cdm" title="https://w2prod.sis.yorku.ca/Apps/WebObjects/cdm">w2prod.sis.yorku.ca/Apps/WebObjects/cdm</a>).</li>
