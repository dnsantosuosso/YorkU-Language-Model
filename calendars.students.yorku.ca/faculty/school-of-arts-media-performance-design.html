            <div><h4>Department of Music</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Music applicants must satisfy the program’s supplemental evaluation.
	<ul>
		<li>All applicants will automatically be sent an evaluation package once the department is advised of your application by the Ontario Universities’ Application Centre.</li>
		<li>The department’s supplemental evaluation package requires applicants to complete the application questionnaire; submit a 500-word essay describing your musical background and the contributions further training will enable you to make to music and society; complete the listening exercises defined in the package; complete the theory test included in the package.</li>
		<li>Applicants have the option of auditioning “in person” or mailing in a recorded submission. Those who wish to attend the “in person” audition should contact the Department of Music (ACE 371) at 416736-5186 to arrange an audition time.</li>
		<li>If you are mailing in your evaluation, please record and submit two contrasting pieces or styles to show the range of your musical skills and interests. Any recording format will be acceptable, i.e. tape cassette, CD, mini disc, DAT, VHS or MP3 files.</li>
		<li>We do not require a professionally produced recording.A good basic audio-cassette recording using a traditional “boom-box” will suffice as long as we can hear your performance clearly.</li>
		<li>Although proficiency on more than one instrument is not required, if you wish to show aptitude on a secondary instrument, one additional piece on the second instrument will suffice.</li>
		<li>We also invite you to submit scores and/or recordings of arrangements or compositions that you have created and essays on music that you have written.</li>
		<li>If you have formal training, you are invited to provide copies of any documentation showing the level of theory/performance/history completed, i.e. RCM grades etc.</li>
	</ul>

            <div><h4>Department of Theatre &amp; Performance</h4>

<ul>
	<li>All applicants will automatically be mailed an evaluation package. Invitations to evaluations will be based on your academic record to date. Applicants are evaluated on the basis of the following:
	<ol>
		<li>A questionnaire focusing on their background in theatre.
		<ul>
			<li>This is not a theatrical skills assessment, but rather an opportunity for applicants to express themselves and exhibit their interest in theatre.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>A public oral presentation of no more than three minutes.
		<ul>
			<li>This presentation could take many forms: for instance, a monologue from a play; or a talk about a production recently seen, directed or designed; or information about a play written by the applicant, or a reading from it giving the background to the work.</li>
			<li>The Department of Theatre &amp; Performance needs to ascertain how applicants present themselves in public, how they perform, or how they speak about some aspect of theatre.</li>
			<li>All applicants—no matter what their area of prime interest—must be prepared to make this public presentation. Therefore, this should be planned in advance.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>A brief personal interview.
		<ul>
			<li>Normally the questionnaire/presentation/interview process will take place during a half-day visit to the Keele campus or in another location closer to the applicant’s home town.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>If there are significant reasons that an applicant cannot attend a personal interview/evaluation, the applicant should discuss with the department other evaluation methods, such as video auditions, portfolio or written submissions and/or telephone interviews.</li>
	<li>Successful applicants will be expected to complete a medical questionnaire prior to beginning classes.</li>
	<li>If further information is required, please contact the Department of Theatre &amp; Performance (CFT 318) at 416-7365172 (<a href="mailto:theadept@yorku.ca">theadept@yorku.ca</a>) or visit the School of the Arts, Media, Performance &amp; Design website at <a href="https://ampd.yorku.ca">ampd.yorku.ca</a>.&nbsp;</li>

<p>School of the Arts, Media, Performance &amp; Design students may also satisfy the humanities general education requirement by taking six credits from the fine arts 1900 3.00 series of courses outside the major program. However, these courses if used to satisfy a humanities course general education requirement, cannot also be counted in another category.</p>

<h5>Non-AMPD Electives</h5>

<p>In addition to the general education courses, some fine arts students are required to complete additional courses outside the fine arts disciplines. The number of non-fine art electives required varies according to the major and degree program. Courses taken towards a major or a minor program in the Faculty of Environmental &amp; Urban Change, the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies, the Faculty of Science, or the Lassonde School of Engineering will satisfy this requirement.</p>

<h5>AMPD Electives</h5>

<p>All student s in an AMPD degree program or an Honours Major/Minor program must complete at least 12 credits in fine arts outside their major discipline. Courses completed as part of a minor program in the School of the Arts, Media, Performance &amp; Design will satisfy this requirement. Fine arts electives are not required in any Honours Double Major program.</p>

<h5>Upper-level Courses</h5>

<p>In all AMPD Specialized Honours programs, at least 24 credits in the major discipline must be at the 3000 or 4000 level. In fine arts BA programs, a minimum of 18 credits (including the 12 major credits) must be at the 3000 or 4000 level. Specific programs and streams may have additional upper requirements.level&nbsp;</p>

	<li><strong>Overall grade point average:</strong>&nbsp;includes all courses (passed and failed) that the student has completed at York.</li>
	<li><strong>Major grade point average:</strong>&nbsp;includes all courses (passed and failed) which count towards the major that the student has completed at York.</li>
	<li><strong>Sessional grade point average:</strong>&nbsp;includes all courses (passed and failed) that the student has completed in the current session at York.</li>
</ul>

<p>All courses taken at York, including failures, are included in grade point average calculations. Courses completed outside York University are not included in grade point averages at York.</p>

<p><strong>Students with no previous postsecondary education:</strong>&nbsp;students who enter the School of the Arts, Media, Performance &amp; Design with no prior experience at a postsecondary educational institution (such as university and college) are automatically admitted to an Honours program.</p>

<p><strong>Transfer students:</strong>&nbsp;students who enter with prior experience at a postsecondary educational institution are admitted to an Honours program if their prior overall grade point average (including failed courses) is at least the equivalent of 5.00 (C+) on the York scale.</p>

<h5>Transferring from a Specialized Honours BA, Specialized Honours BFA to a BA Program</h5>

<p><strong>Ineligibility to continue in Honours:</strong>&nbsp;students whose overall and/or major GPA falls below the progression requirements, may continue their studies only in a BA degree program. Please see the eligibility to maintain Honours status chart below. Specialized Honours BA students will automatically be placed in the BA program. Honours BFA students must submit a Program Change Request, available on the Program Change Web page at&nbsp;<a href="https://myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/program-change" title="Program Change">myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/program-change</a>, if they wish to continue their studies.</p>

<p><strong>Re-entering Honours:</strong>&nbsp;students who have been transferred to the BA program because of a GPA which falls below the requirements to maintain Honours status, may re-enter Honours if they raise their overall and major grade point averages to the requirements or above as specified in each year level, by the session in which they have successfully completed their 90th credit. Students who have not reached 5.00 (C+) in the session in which they successfully complete their 90th credit may request to graduate with a BA degree if they fulfill the BA degree requirements, or may continue in a BA program until those requirements are fulfilled.</p>

            <div><h4>Academic Standing Requirements for Visiting Students</h4>

<p>Individuals who wish to enrol in undergraduate credit courses, but who do not intend to complete a degree or a certificate may be admitted to York as a visiting student (see the Admissions section for more information). (<strong>Please note:</strong>&nbsp;in addition to the regular requirements for admission to the University, the School of the Arts, Media, Performance &amp; Design requires an evaluation of an applicant’s suitability for many of its programs). There are three categories of visiting students:</p>

<ol>
	<li>those who hold an undergraduate degree (three-year’s degree minimum) from an accredited university/university-level institution;</li>
	<li>those who do not hold an undergraduate degree but wish to enrol in York courses to fulfill the academic, upgrading or professional development requirements of a professional designation;</li>
	<li>those who are currently attending another recognized university and wish to take York courses on a letter of permission issued by their home institution.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement</h5>

<p>Students in categories a) and b) whose overall cumulative grade point average (OCGPA) falls below 4.00 on at least 24 credits attempted will not be allowed to enrol in any subsequent session as visiting students. Students who are not permitted to re-enrol must apply for re-admission through the Admissions Office.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;repeated course legislation does not apply to visiting students but only to academic degrees and certificates. Therefore, all courses attempted or taken will count in the OCGPA.</p>

<h5>Credit Limits</h5>

<p>Students in category b) who have maintained an OCGPA of 4.00 or higher throughout their studies and who have completed 30 credits will not be allowed to enrol in subsequent sessions and must either reactivate to proceed as visiting students or may choose to apply for admission to a degree or certificate program. This pause allows students in category (b) an opportunity to reconsider options to apply to degree studies given the transfer credit implications.</p>

            <div><h4>Alternative Grading Option (Pass/Fail)</h4>

<p>Students in good standing may, after successfully completing 24 credits, enrol in up to 12 credits on an ungraded (pass/fail) basis. Courses taken on an ungraded basis may not be used to satisfy major, minor, general education or certificate requirements. Courses taken on an ungraded basis are recorded as P (pass) or F (fail), and neither grade is included in the calculation of grade point averages.</p>

<p>To designate a course as ungraded, a student must complete an application form available at Registrarial Services and submit it to that office before the end of the second week of classes in the course.</p>

<p>It is possible to revert to the regular grading scheme after choosing the alternative grading option. The Registrar’s Office must be notified of this decision no later than the last day to withdraw from the course without academic penalty.</p>
</div>
      </div>
              <div>
            <div><h4>Repeated Passed or Failed Courses</h4>

<p>Students may repeat a passed or failed course twice for academic degree or certificate credit, for a maximum of three (3) attempts at a course. Students should note that course availability and space considerations may preclude the possibility of repeating a course in the session they choose.</p>

<p>Credit towards your degree will only be counted once for repeated courses taken at York or elsewhere. All repeated passed or failed attempts are subject to the University&nbsp;<em><a href="https://calendars.students.yorku.ca/2023-2024/policy-on-repeating-passed-or-failed-courses-for-academic-credit" title="Policy on Repeating Passed or Failed Courses For Academic Credit">Policy on Repeating Passed or Failed Courses For Academic Credit</a></em>.</p>
</div>
      </div>
              <div>
            <div><h4>Grading Policy</h4>

<ol>
	<li>Within the first two classes, a course outline must be provided to each student. Such an outline should announce the means of determining the final grade in a course. Such information must include the kinds of assignments, essays, examinations and other components which make up the grade; their relative weights; and any other procedures which enter into the determination of the final grade.</li>
	<li>In exceptional circumstances, a previously announced marking scheme for a course may be changed; the new marking scheme must also be distributed in written form. Any changes to a previously announced marking scheme must have the consent of all students registered in the course, such consent to be signified by their signatures.</li>
	<li>Feedback during course: instructors are obligated to provide a mechanism by which students can be apprised of their progress in a course; in particular, students must be able to make an informed decision on whether to withdraw from a course. This will normally mean that students will receive graded feedback on work worth at least 15 per cent of the course grade before the deadline to withdraw from that course.</li>
	<li>No examination or test worth more than 20 per cent of the course grade may be scheduled during the last two weeks of class time, but must be scheduled during the formal exam period.</li>
	<li>Grades submitted by an instructor are subject to review by the teaching unit in which the course is offered.</li>
</ol>
</div>
      </div>
              <div>
            <div><h4>Grade Reappraisals</h4>

<p>Students may, with sufficient academic grounds, request that a final grade in a course be reappraised (which may mean the review of specific pieces of tangible work). Non-academic grounds are not relevant for grade reappraisals; in such cases, students are advised to petition to their home Faculty. Students are normally expected to first contact the course director to discuss the grade received and to request that their tangible work be reviewed.</p>

<p>Further information may be obtained from the unit offering the course. Students submitting a formal request to have a grade reappraised in a School of the Arts, Media, Performance &amp; Design course should note the following:</p>

<p><strong>Deadlines:</strong>&nbsp;requests for reappraisal must be filed within three weeks of the release of grade reports for the term.</p>

<p><strong>Reassessable work:</strong>&nbsp;students may question the overall course grade or the marking of the specific pieces of work. For reassessment of specific projects or assignments, tangible evidence of the original submitted work must be provided. Tangible work may include: graphic, modelled, video recording or audio recording, and are acceptable formats for reassessment. The live performance component of any course is excluded from grade reappraisal.</p>

<p><strong>Possible grade changes:</strong>&nbsp;when a student asks for a reappraisal of a grade or assignment, an original grade may be raised, lowered or confirmed.</p>

<p><strong>Faculty appeal procedures:</strong>&nbsp;the decision of the department may be appealed only on grounds of procedural irregularity or new evidence. Appeals to grade reappraisals must be submitted to OAISS, School of the Arts, Media, Performance &amp; Design.</p>
</div>
      </div>
              <div>
            <div><h4>Deferred Standing</h4>

<p>Deferred standing may be recorded and in effect in the following cases:</p>

<ol>
	<li>If a student has missed an examination, or has not completed the course work due to sickness or other misfortune, it is the student’s responsibility to make arrangements with the instructor to complete the course and to file a deferred standing agreement with the department by the specified deadline.</li>
	<li>If the nature of the academic exercise precludes the completion of certain course requirements before the grading deadlines, it is the instructor’s responsibility to provide a written rationale to the Academic/Administrative Policy and Planning Committee.</li>
</ol>
</div>
      </div>
              <div>
            <div><h4>Aegrotat Standing</h4>

<p>In cases where deferred standing is not possible, students may be granted aegrotat standing (AEG) on the grounds of sickness, accident or family misfortune. Aegrotat standing excuses students from completing the remaining and required work for a course or courses although course credit is granted. The notation AEG is recorded on the transcript in place of a final grade. Aegrotat standing is normally dependent upon the student’s having completed 75 per cent of the required course work at a minimum C+ level. Requests for aegrotat standing will not be considered before the final date for withdrawal from a course.</p>

<p>Petitions for aegrotat standing must be submitted to the Registrar’s Office with documentation substantiating the misfortune and written support from the instructor(s). The petition will then be considered by the Faculty Academic/Administrative Policy and Planning Committee.</p>

<p>Aegrotat standing is seldom granted and will not be granted for more than one academic session prior to the completion of a degree.</p>

	<h3>
            <div>Policy on Academic Honesty</div>
      </h3>	<div class="content">
		
      <div>
              <div>
            <div><h4>Definitions</h4>

<p><strong>Student work:</strong>&nbsp;fine arts student work covered by rules regarding academic honesty includes papers, research, tests, examinations and all forms of studio and production work as practised within the School.</p>

<p><strong>Breaches of academic honesty:</strong>&nbsp;please consult the Senate Policy on Academic Honesty for a discussion of academic honesty and definitions of breach of academic honesty. Among other issues, the senate policy discusses offences such as cheating; submission of one piece of work in satisfaction of two assignments without prior informed consent; impersonation; plagiarism and other misappropriation of the work of another; abuse of confidentiality; falsification or forgery of documents; obstruction of the academic activities of another; aiding or abetting academic misconduct; failure to divulge previous attendance at another postsecondary educational institution on an admissions application etc. In particular, students taking courses in the School of the Arts, Media, Performance &amp; Design should be mindful of the dangers of misappropriation and misrepresentation which are breaches of academic honesty.</p>

<p><strong>Misappropriation of another’s work:</strong>&nbsp;in the creation and presentation of all studio and performance work, and all other artistic and technical works, students who use the work of others must clearly state the extent and nature of the appropriation to their instructor. Failure to do so shall constitute a breach of academic honesty.</p>

<p><strong>Misrepresentation of collaborative projects:</strong>&nbsp;failure to give appropriate credit to collaborators, or the listing of others as collaborators who have not contributed to the work, shall constitute a breach of academic honesty.</p>
</div>
      </div>
              <div>
            <div><h4>Procedures</h4>

<ol>
	<li>The Senate Policy on Academic Honesty governs the procedures of the Faculty in cases of alleged breaches of academic honesty.</li>
	<li>Any faculty member suspecting that a student has engaged in a breach of academic honesty shall notify the associate dean, or designate, who shall in turn assist the faculty member in following the procedures provided in the senate policy.</li>
	<li>The associate dean of the Faculty shall be the Faculty person responsible for the carriage of all cases of breaches of academic honesty.</li>
	<li>The Academic/Administrative Policy and Planning Committee shall be the body responsible for hearing cases of breaches of academic honesty and imposing penalties.</li>
</ol>
</div>
      </div>
              <div>
            <div><h4>Procedural Guidelines</h4>

<ol>
	<li>If an instructor believes an offence has occurred, the student should be sent a notice in writing from the office of the Academic Affairs Governance Officer that an offence is suspected, and that the instructor or course director wishes to meet with the student. The student will be informed that a representative may accompany her/him and that the meeting will be on the record. A deadline for responding of no less than seven calendar days will be imposed. The student will also be informed that the course in question may not be dropped (as per Senate Policy, E 4). Further procedures as defined in the Senate Policy, item D 3, a and b will apply.</li>
	<li>If the instructor or course director decides to pursue the matter, the following material will be sent to the associate dean’s office:
	<ul>
		<li>the contested piece of work&nbsp;(if possible);</li>
		<li>the evidence supporting the alleged offence;</li>
		<li>the record of the meeting;</li>
		<li>the course syllabus and relevant assignment sheets;</li>
		<li>any handout on academic offences;</li>
		<li>record of student’s performance in the course to date;</li>
		<li>student’s written admission of guilt and joint recommendation of instructor and student as to penalty, if applicable;</li>
		<li>any other relevant materials.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If the student chooses not to attend the aforementioned meeting, this material will be sent after the time limit for arranging that meeting has expired.</p>
	</li>
	<li>The associate dean will present the case to the Academic/Administrative Policy and Planning Committee, which is the relevant committee empowered to hear such cases and to impose penalties. All further procedures as defined in the senate policy will be followed.</li>
</ol>
</div>
      </div>
              <div>
            <div><h4>Penalties</h4>

<p>When a student has been found to have committed a breach of academic honesty, without limiting the ultimate discretion of the Faculty committee to impose any or all of the penalties set out in the senate policy as may be warranted in the circumstances, the committee may impose any or all of the following penalties:</p>

<ol>
	<li>a failure in the course;</li>
	<li>failure in the course and a notation of breach of academic honesty on the transcript;</li>
	<li>suspension;</li>
	<li>expulsion with transcript notation.</li>
</ol>
