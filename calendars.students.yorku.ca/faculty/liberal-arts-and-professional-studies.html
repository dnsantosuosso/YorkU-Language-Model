            <div><p><u>&nbsp;</u>In addition to taking courses which contribute to their broad knowledge, students are required to specialize in a specific subject or combination of subjects. The area of primary concentration is known as the major; an area of secondary concentration (if any) is known as the minor. In a double major program, a course may count for major credit towards only one major. In a major/minor program, a course may count only for major credit or for minor credit.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Students may choose to major or minor in a specific subject when they enter the University or they may wait until they have completed up to 24 credits. At this point, students must choose a major and possibly a minor, but subsequent changes are possible. In selecting courses, students who are undecided should try to take introductory courses in a number of potential major subjects. This will allow them to proceed in their subject(s) of choice without the possibility of a delay.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Cross-listed courses may not be double counted in order to fulfil major requirements. For example, if AP/SOCI 3030 6.00 is cross-listed to AP/POLS 3300 6.00, it may be counted as a sociology course or a political science course, but not as both.</p>

<p><u>Upper-level Credits</u><br />
<u>&nbsp;</u>The Faculty also considers it good educational practice to ensure that students take a number of credits at the 3000 level and/or 4000 level. (A course's level is indicated by the first digit of its number.)</p>

<u>&nbsp;</u>Credits outside the major are courses which are intended to broaden the educational experience of students beyond their area of specialization. Credits outside the major include most courses which are not used to fulfil the general education requirements or major/minor requirements. Please refer to programs of study section for program specific information.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Courses which are not considered as fulfilling the credits outside the major requirement:</p>

<ul>
	<li>major/minor courses taken above the required number, non-major/minor courses taken within the major/minor subject (e.g. AP/FR 1020 6.00 is a non-major French course);</li>
	<li>courses outside the major/minor taken to fulfil major/minor requirements;<br />
	&nbsp;courses which are cross-listed or designated as course substitutes to courses offered by the major/minor program (e.g. SC/MATH 1530 3.00 is cross-listed to AP/ECON 1530 3.00);</li>
	<li>cross-listed courses used to fulfil the major requirements may not also be used to fulfil the outside the major credits requirement.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Minimum Requirements by Program Type</u><br />
<u>&nbsp;</u>The following minimum requirements apply to all Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies students. Each program of study (major or minor) may stipulate additional requirements. For details of individual programs, refer to the Programs of Study section. Also consult the section on Academic Standing.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In order to graduate with an Honours BA degree, students must achieve satisfactory academic standing to enter, proceed and graduate and must successfully complete (pass) a minimum of 120 credits which fulfil all of the following requirements.<br />

&nbsp;<br />
students registered in any Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies degree or program must complete at least half (50 per cent) of each major or minor at York;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
in some instances, in order to complete the requirements of an Honours Double Major or Honours Major/Minor program, it may be necessary to successfully complete (pass) more than 120 credits;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies degree requirements and program regulations apply;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies students successfully completing a BA, BDEM Honours Double Major or BA, BDEM or BPA Honours Major/Minor programs combined with other programs or Faculties will receive the applicable BA, BDEM or BPA Honours degree.</p>

<p><u>Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change</u><br />
<u>&nbsp;</u>Students in the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies may combine any Honours Double Major BA, BDEM or Honours Major/Minor BA, BDEM or BPA program with the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change.

<u>&nbsp;</u>Students in the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies may combine any Honours Double Major BA, BDEM or Honours Major/Minor BA, BDEM or BPA program with the Faculty of Health.

<p><u>Co-registration in the Faculty of Education</u><br />
<u>&nbsp;</u>Students enrolled in a BA program in the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies may apply for admission to the Pre-Service program of the Faculty of Education.

&nbsp;<br />
Although liberal arts and professional studies and education courses are taken concurrently, they are counted separately by each Faculty. Grade point averages for courses in the two Faculties are also calculated separately. The 30 credits required for the BEd are independent of the 120 credits required for the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies Honours BA or the 90 credits required for the BA. Therefore, a student completing the requirements for both degrees would complete a minimum total of 150 credits for the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies Honours BA/BEd or 120 credits for the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies BA/BEd.</p>

<p><u>Credit for Education Courses</u><br />
<u>&nbsp;</u>Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies students who are co-registered in the Faculty of Education may count education courses taken beyond the requirements for the BEd for credit towards the Honours BA or BA degree as credits outside the major.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies students who are not co-registered in the Faculty of Education may receive degree credit for academic courses offered by the Faculty of Education as credits outside the major.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Students in the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change, the Faculty of Health, the Faculty of Science, the School of the Arts, Media, Performance and Design, or the Lassonde School of Engineering may also combine an Honours Double Major BA or Honours Major/Minor BA program with the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies.

<p>All approved general education courses may count for general education credits; some may count for major credits; none may count as both.</p>

<p>The Creative Writing program is an Honours program. Students who wish to apply for admission to the program are strongly advised to take one of the following courses among their first 30 University credits:</p>

<ul>
	<li>AP/EN 1001 3.00</li>
	<li>AP/EN 1002 3.00</li>
	<li>AP/EN 1006 3.00</li>
	<li>AP/WRIT 1700 9.00 (cross-listed to: AP/HUMA 1700 9.00)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> a maximum of six credits from the courses listed above will count for creative writing major or minor credit.</p>

<p>Students may enrol in the Faculty of Liberal Arts &amp; Professional Studies in Honours or in the Fine Arts Studies Program.</p>

<p>Students who are in the School of the Arts, Media, Performance and Design should plan a course of studies with the approval of both the Creative Writing and Fine Arts program. If you are registered in the School of the Arts, Media, Performance and Design you will be expected to meet the requirements of the Fine Arts Studies Program.</p>

<p>Students must successfully complete AP/CWR 2600 6.00 or its equivalent before applying for admission to the Creative Writing program as a major or minor. Students taking AP/CWR 2600 6.00 who wish to obtain full admission to the program as a major or minor should submit a 15-20 page portfolio of poetry and prose fiction following completion of AP/CWR 2600 6.00.</p>

<p>Students may also apply for full admission after their first 48 credits and before completion of their first 78 credits by presenting a portfolio containing work in both poetry and prose fiction as evidence of writing experience equivalent to that provided by AP/CWR 2600 6.00. In either case, applicants must also fill out a Creative Writing program application form. Acceptance of the portfolio by the Creative Writing Committee constitutes full admission to the Honours Major or Honours Minor program. Students who have not taken AP/CWR 2600 6.00 are advised six additional workshop credits will be required to take the place of AP/CWR 2600 6.00 in their Major program.</p>

<p>Prospective students are reminded that Creative Writing is an Honours only program, obliging both prospective students and continuing students to maintain Honours Standing.</p>

<p>It is strongly recommended that students in the Honours BA program combine creative writing with another major or minor.</p>

	<li>The focus of the degree programs is on the modern period. However, it is emphasized that students should also learn to appreciate the cultural traditions behind developments during the 19th and 20th centuries.</li>
	<li>East Asian studies is an interdisciplinary program. Students are trained to use the concepts, skills and information of at least two academic disciplines.</li>
	<li>Competence in an East Asian language (usually Chinese or Japanese or Korean) is a feature of all the degree programs except the Honours Minor.</li>
</ol>

<p>Within the general guidelines and requirements, a student could choose from a rich array of course offerings every year to create a combination which best serves their academic interests and career aspirations. Students should consult the coordinator when designing their programs of study.</p>

            <div><p>The Economics program focuses on those aspects of social behaviour and those institutions which are involved in the allocation of scarce resources among alternative uses in the pursuit of the satisfaction of human wants. Through a unique teaching approach that blends theory and application, you will gain in-depth knowledge of the analytical and quantitative tools of economic analysis as you apply them to understand and solve of a wide range of individual and social problems about consumption and production in a variety of markets (product, labour, capital, etc., both nationally and internationally) which arise because of resource scarcity. You will be able to pursue a degree in Economics at the BA Specialized Honours, BA Honours, or BA level.</p>

            <div><p>All students majoring or minoring in English must take one of the following courses or course sequences in their first year: AP/EN 1001 3.00 and AP/EN 1002 3.00; AP/EN 1101 6.00; AP/EN 1102 6.00; or AP/EN 1103 6.00. They must successfully complete AP/EN 1001 3.00 with a minimum grade of D (50%) before they may take AP/EN 1002 3.00, and complete AP/EN 1002 3.00 with a minimum grade of C (60%) before they will be permitted to continue in English. They must achieve a minimum grade of C (60%) in AP/EN 1101 6.00, AP/EN 1102 6.00 or AP/EN 1103 6.00 to continue in English. Students may only count six credits from a 1000-level English course towards their major or minor program.</p>

<p>Students majoring or minoring in English are required to take a minimum number of credits in courses focusing on literature from before the 20th century. Such courses fall into two categories: I) pre-18th century literature (from before 1700), and II) pre-20th century literature (from between 1700 and 1900). Students should fulfil this requirement within the overall number of credits required for their English degree. Students may not count more than six credits from the 2170 and/or 3170 series of AP/EN courses (the Popular Genres series) for major or minor credit in English.</p>

<p>Among the total number of credits required for:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Honours BAs with English as a Minor, or Regular BAs, students pursuing those degrees must take at least three credits overall in courses from either group I or II;</li>
	<li>Honours BAs, Honours Double Major BAs, or Honours Double Major Interdisciplinary BAs, or Honours Major/Minor BAs, students pursuing those degrees must take at least three credits in courses from group I and at least three credits in courses from group II; and</li>
	<li>Specialized Honours BAs, students pursuing those degrees must take at least nine credits in courses from groups I and II overall – they may satisfy this requirement by taking either: a) at least six credits from group I and at least three credits from group II, or b) at least three credits from group I and at least six credits from group II.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, Minors and Regular BAs may satisfy this requirement by accumulating at least three credits in courses from group I or II. Honours and Specialized Honours BAs must take courses in both groups I and II. Honours BAs must take at least six credits across the two groups. Specialized Honours BAs must take at least 9 credits across the two groups.</p>

<p>English courses in groups I and II will be identified on the English Department's web page. Students should check there to choose courses that satisfy this requirement and to see whether their previously completed courses satisfy this requirement.</p>

<p>This requirement applies to all first-, second -year students in these degree programs in Fall 2014, and all majors and minors in English thereafter.</p>

<p>For a complete list of courses and detailed reading lists, refer to the department's website at <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/laps/en/">yorku.ca/laps/en/</a>.</p>

<p>Students intending to proceed to graduate school should take a broad range of courses, should avoid concentration in only one period or genre and, in consultation with a member of the English Department, should plan a degree program with the understanding that certain traditional subjects may be regarded as essential by some graduate schools.</p>

<p>Students intending to teach in Ontario schools must meet the varied requirements of various Faculties of Education and are advised to construct a balanced degree program by doing at least some work in each major period in literary history; such students should consult specific Faculties of Education about their regulations.</p>

<p>Students are responsible for planning their course of study and for ensuring that all degree and major requirements are met. The department will provide advisers during the summer months, fall and winter terms to advise those students who have questions about their program or about English studies in general. Enquiries may be made through the Undergraduate Office, 524 Atkinson, 416-736-5166.</p>

            <div><h3>Specialized Honours BA: 120 Credits</h3>

<p>The Specialized Honours degree in English and Professional Writing (ENPR) requires 78 credits in the major. The specialized nature of this program lies in the blending of English and Professional Writing into a single degree program that highlights and enhances the relationship between the two fields of study. Such a degree option will provide students with a course of study that is more coherent and viable than an English and Professional Writing double major or major/minor, degrees in which the two fields are treated as separate rather than complementary areas of study.</p>

<p><strong>Residency requirement:</strong> a minimum of 30 course credits and at least half (50 per cent) of the course credits required in each undergraduate degree program major/minor must be taken at York University.</p>

<p><strong>Graduation requirement:</strong> students must successfully complete (pass) at least 120 credits which meet the Faculty's degree and program requirements with a cumulative grade point average of at least 5.00.</p>

<p><strong>General education:</strong> a minimum of 21 general education credits as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>6.00 credits in natural science (NATS)</li>
	<li>a 9.00 credit approved general education course in the social science or humanities categories</li>
	<li>a 6.00 credit approved general education course in the opposite category to the 9.00 credit course in social science or humanities already taken</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Major credits:</strong> students must complete 78 credits in English and Professional Writing, including:</p>

<h4>(i) Program Core Courses</h4>

<h5>1000-level (15 credits)</h5>

<ul>
	<li>AP/EN 1001 3.00 (F)</li>
	<li>AP/EN 1002 3.00 (W)</li>
	<li>AP/WRIT 1003 6.00</li>
	<li>AP/WRIT 1004 3.00</li>
</ul>

<h5>2000-level (21 credits)</h5>

<ul>
	<li>AP/PRWR 2006 3.00</li>
	<li>AP/PRWR 2007 3.00</li>
	<li>AP/WRIT 2003 6.00 (Y)</li>
	<li>AP/WRIT 2004 3.00</li>
	<li>six additional credits from 2000-level AP/EN courses, not in Professional Writing</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> students may complete a maximum of six (6) credits from the 2200 series of AP/EN courses for major credit in English and Professional Writing.</p>

<p><strong>Credits outside the major:</strong> at least 18 credits outside of the Writing Department and English Department.</p>

<h4>(ii) Upper-Year Requirements</h4>

<p>For the Professional Writing portion of the ENPR program, students will choose from the Writing Department's Keystone and Capstone courses. The 3000-level Keystone courses serve as prerequisites for the 4000-level Capstone courses. Therefore, to select from the 4000-level Capstone courses, students must first complete the correlating and prerequisite 3000-level Keystone courses (for example, students will complete AP/WRIT 3001 3.00 before beginning AP/WRIT 4001 6.00).</p>

<p>The experiential Capstone courses build on the theoretical and critical knowledge and practical skills developed throughout the first three years of the Professional Writing Program.</p>

<h5>3000-level (18 credits)</h5>

<ul>
	<li>six (6) credits chosen from:
	<ul>
		<li>AP/WRIT 3001 3.00</li>
		<li>AP/WRIT 3002 3.00</li>
		<li>AP/WRIT 3003 3.00</li>
		<li>AP/WRIT 3004 3.00</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>six (6) additional credits in Professional Writing</li>
	<li>six (6) credits in 3000-level AP/EN courses, not in Professional Writing</li>
</ul>

<h5>4000-level (24 credits)</h5>

<ul>
	<li>Twelve (12) credits chosen from the Writing Department's current list of experiential capstone courses:
	<ul>
		<li>AP/WRIT 4001 6.00</li>
		<li>AP/WRIT 4002 6.00</li>
		<li>AP/WRIT 4003 6.00</li>
		<li>AP/WRIT 4004 6.00 **</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>twelve (12) credits in 4000-level AP/EN courses, not in Professional Writing</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Credits outside the major</strong>: at least 18 credits.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> students may complete a maximum of six (6) credits from AP/EN 3170-3179 courses for major credit in English and Professional Writing</p>

<h3>English Course Requirements</h3>

<p>Students must conform to the English Department guidelines for choosing courses at each year level. Please refer to the English Department guidelines for this information.</p>

<p>Please also note that that students must achieve a mark of 60 per cent (C) or better in AP/EN 1002 3.00 to continue in the program. This is a programmatic requirement for all English degrees.</p>

<h3>Out-of-Faculty Courses</h3>

<p>Subject to course exclusions, program requirements/restrictions and residency requirements, out-of-Faculty courses may normally count for program credit toward a Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies degree.</p>

<p>The following out-of-Faculty courses will not count for program credit toward a Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies degree in English and professional writing:</p>

<ul>
	<li>GL/EN 2585 3.00;</li>
	<li>GL/EN 2605 6.00;</li>
	<li>GL/EN 3240 6.00;</li>
	<li>GL/EN 3606 3.00 (cross-listed to: GL/LIN 3606 3.00);</li>

            <div><p>The Financial and Business Economics program combines a rigorous quantitative and analytical approach with practical application designed for students who are particularly interested in pursuing careers in the financial sector and/or graduate education in financial economics. The program is highly structured and provides a broad understanding of the economic framework upon which financial theory is based. Through a blend of economic theory and applied tools of modern finance, you will develop a solid knowledge of the microeconomic principles underlying financial markets and instruments, the macroeconomic role of finance, and the quantitative tools commonly used for analyzing financial markets. You will be able to pursue a degree in financial and business economics at the Specialized Honours BA level.</p>

            <div><p>The Department of French Studies offers courses in three curricular areas: language, linguistics and literature.</p>

<p>The language sequence is a required series of language-skills courses which prepare the student for further study in the areas of linguistics and literature. AP/FR 1080 6.00 is a prerequisite to all other 2000-level courses in the department. Students who have successfully completed AP/FR 1030 6.00 or its equivalent will be eligible to take AP/FR 1080 6.00. Students enrolling in a Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies French course for the first time must complete a French language questionnaire prior to enrolment. Failure to do so will result in denial of access to the course and/or de-enrolment from the course.</p>

<p>In order to proceed to any French studies course offered at a higher level, students must obtain a minimum grade of C in each course taken within the language sequence. Students majoring or minoring in French studies must take all levels of the language sequence courses unless they are exempted from one or more levels on the recommendation of the department.</p>

<p>To this core of language-skills courses, majors will add further courses in French linguistics and in French literature. Students are advised that their choice of courses is also governed by departmental regulations specifying the numbers and levels of courses taken to satisfy the various program requirements. Students are encouraged to meet with the undergraduate program director.</p>

<p>The Department of French Studies offers the following French language courses for non-majors/minors: AP/FR 1020 6.00, AP/FR 1030 6.00, AP/FR 1060 6.00, AP/FR 2060 3.00, AP/FR 2061 3.00, AP/FR 3060 3.00 and AP/FR 3061 3.00.</p>

<p>Students may spend one semester or one full academic year at a francophone university. In the case of students entering this program after the completion of 24 credits, a grade of B+ in AP/FR 1080 6.00 is the minimum requirement. For students entering the program after the successful completion of 48 credits, a grade of B+ in AP/FR 2081 3.00 or AP/FR 2082 3.00 is the minimum requirement. A minimum grade of B in either AP/FR 2100 6.00 or AP/FR 2200 6.00 is also required. In all cases, the student must have a sessional average of 6.00 (B) or above. Detailed information concerning this extra-mural year is available from the Department of French Studies or York International.</p>

<p>For graduate programs in French Literature, several periods of French literature may be required. For graduate programs in French Linguistics, for certain French teaching programs (BEd, MEd, M.A.T.), or for schools of translation and interpretation, an undergraduate concentration in French linguistics may be favoured. Degree students may take more than the minimum number of required courses at any level.</p>

            <div><p>The Gender and Women's Studies Program offers interdisciplinary courses on women and gender that encourage students to develop the practical, theoretical, communication and organizational skills to think, write and act critically and creatively. Students will gain the skills necessary to conduct research and transform the knowledge gained into any future career they may choose, including an ongoing career as a graduate student. Our interdisciplinary courses explore relations of power in the lives of individuals, groups and cultures in a multiplicity of settings and sites locally and transnationally. The rich, interdisciplinary feminist scholarship in women's and gender studies pushes students to interrogate constructions and intersections of gender, race, class, age, ability and sexuality in daily life, popular culture, the arts, the sciences, politics, society, the economy etc. We encourage students to engage individually and collectively in the transformative processes of feminist scholarship, practices and politics.</p>

<p>The School of Gender, Sexuality and Women's Studies unites academic resources at York University in gender and women's studies and sexuality studies, bringing together the undergraduate and graduate programs, the non-credit Bridging Program for Women and the Centre for Feminist Research. Courses may be taken at the Glendon Campus in English or in French and in the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies.</p>

<p>For purposes of meeting program requirements, all nine-credit general education (foundation) courses will count as six credits towards the major, minor or certificate.</p>

<p><strong>All approved general education courses may count for general education credits; some may count for major credits; none may count as both.</strong></p>

<p>Please consult the School of Gender, Sexuality and Women's Studies website for further information, available at <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/laps/gsws/gwst/">yorku.ca/laps/gsws/gwst/</a> or contact the School's main office, 206 Founders College, 416-650-8144 (press 1).</p>

            <div><p>German Studies is an interdisciplinary program that embraces subjects ranging from language, literature and film studies to intellectual and cultural history, urban studies, political science, museum studies, art history and women's studies. Students may opt for an Honours BA, an Honours iBA, a BA, an Honours Double Major, an Honours Double Major (Interdisciplinary), an Honours Major/Minor or an Honours Minor. The Department of Languages, Literatures and Linguistics also offers a Certificate of Proficiency in German Language.</p>

<p>Students can choose from the following degree options: German Studies: German Language, Literature and Culture Stream, German Studies: German Culture and Society Stream and iBA German studies. Each of these consists of core courses taught by our faculty.</p>

<p>The degree option in German Studies: German Language, Literature and Culture Stream requires an advanced knowledge of the German language and courses in German literature and culture, most of which have the German language component.</p>

<p>The degree in German Studies: German Culture and Society Stream requires an intermediate knowledge of the German language and courses in German culture, as well as courses with significant German content taught by other departments.</p>

<p>The iBA German studies has the same requirements as the Honours BA German studies and also includes an international component in which students can spend one full term abroad in a German-speaking country as a full-time student at one of our exchange universities. Students entering this program must make an appointment with the program coordinator of German studies prior to enrolment.</p>

<p>For purposes of meeting program requirements, all nine-credit general education (foundation) courses will count as six credits towards the major or minor.</p>

<p>All approved general education courses may count for general education credits; some may count for major credits; none may count as both.</p>

<p>Students who are exempted from German language courses based on their knowledge of German must still successfully complete the total number of credits required for their chosen stream.</p>

<h3>Honours BA: 120 Credits</h3>

<p><strong>Residency requirement:</strong> a minimum of 30 course credits and at least half (50 per cent) of the course credits required in each undergraduate degree program major/minor must be taken at York University.</p>

<p><strong>Graduation requirement:</strong> students must successfully complete (pass) at least 120 credits which meet the Faculty's degree and program requirements with a cumulative grade point average of at least 5.00.</p>

<p><strong>General education:</strong> a minimum of 21 general education credits as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>6.00 credits in natural science (NATS)</li>
	<li>a 9.00 credit approved general education course in the social science or humanities categories</li>
	<li>a 6.00 credit approved general education course in the opposite category to the 9.00 credit course in social science or humanities already taken</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Major credits:</strong> students must complete 42 credits from one of the streams below.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Students are required to complete six credits in history at the 1000 level. 1000-level courses at the Glendon Campus or other universities do not satisfy this requirement. Exemptions may only be granted, at the discretion of the director of undergraduate studies, to students who have taken a minimum of 18 credits in history and have earned a minimum B+ history grade point average. Students granted an exemption must take a substitute six-credit upper-level course in history. No more than six credits in history at the 1000 level may count towards the major.</li>
	<li>The department offers two types of 4000-level courses: Honours seminars and colloquia. Honours seminars normally enrol about 18 students and have a substantial research component. Colloquia normally enrol 30 students. Honours major degree students must take at least one 4000-level seminar (six credits). Specialized Honours degree students must take two 4000-level seminars (12 credits). For a list of approved 4000-level History seminar courses, please refer below*.</li>
	<li>AP/HIST 4000 6.00 and AP/HIST 4991 3.00 / AP/HIST 4991 6.00 count as seminars. AP/HIST 4990 3.00 / AP/HIST 4990 6.00 counts as a colloquium.</li>
	<li>4000-level history courses taken at the Glendon Campus will count as seminars if they have planned enrolments of fewer than 20 students.</li>
	<li>Honours students may register online for 4000-level history courses after successful completion of 84 credits including the prerequisite course or courses officially listed for each 4000-level course. If they do not meet these requirements, students who have completed at least 78 credits may apply to the director of undergraduate studies for permission to enrol in 4000-level history courses. Students will be asked to show some previous coursework that prepares them in the field of study.</li>

<h3>Specialized Honours BA: 120 Credits</h3>

<p>The Specialized Honours program in Individualized Studies is designed for students who wish to pursue a topic or line of enquiry that requires drawing together courses from several of the University's disciplines or fields of study.</p>

<p>Students interested in pursuing an individualized studies degree will be asked by the coordinator to prepare a statement describing the particular subject they wish to pursue. They will also be asked to identify a set of courses, from the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies and elsewhere, which are relevant to this theme. If the coordinator is satisfied that the proposed subject cannot be adequately pursued under an established program or departmental major and that sufficient courses and faculty expertise exist to support individualized study in the area in question, the student will be permitted to enter the Individualized Studies program. Normally, students are eligible to join the program if they have completed at least 24 credits and no more than 66 credits by the start of the academic year.</p>

<p><strong>Residency requirement:</strong> a minimum of 30 course credits and at least half (50 per cent) of the course credits required in each undergraduate degree program major/minor must be taken at York University.</p>

<p><strong>Graduation requirement:</strong> students must successfully complete (pass) at least 120 credits which meet the Faculty's degree and program requirements with a cumulative grade point average of at least 5.00.</p>

<p><strong>General education:</strong> a minimum of 21 general education credits as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>6.00 credits in natural science (NATS)</li>
	<li>a 9.00 credit approved general education course in the social science or humanities categories</li>
	<li>a 6.00 credit approved general education course in the opposite category to the 9.00 credit course in social science or humanities already taken</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Major credits:</strong> students in individualized studies must successfully complete and follow all the regulations for a degree in Specialized Honours in the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies. In addition, they must take, as part of the 54 credits relevant to their theme, the Individualized Studies Thesis Course, AP/INDV 4000 6.00.

            <div><p>The Department of Languages, Literatures and Linguistics offers courses in linguistics leading to BA and Honours BA degrees, with 30-credit, 42-credit and 54-credit major concentrations.</p>

<p>Linguistics is the scientific study of natural language organization. It concerns itself with discovering the universal principles of human language and applying these principles to provide systematic descriptions of individual languages. To this purpose, linguists investigate sound and word patterns, sentence structure, language usage and change, the acquisition of first and second languages, as well as the relationship between language and the mind and language and society.</p>

<p>Because language mediates virtually all forms of human endeavour, the study of linguistics can provide new perspectives on almost every aspect of the humanities and social sciences. In addition, it has applications to primary and secondary education, speech-language pathology and the applied sciences of communication engineering and computer science.</p>

<p>In any of the programs described below, a student taking both AP/LING 1000 6.00 and AP/LING 2060 6.00 will be required to complete an additional three credits in linguistics to satisfy the linguistics component of the degree.</p>

<p><strong>General education:</strong> a minimum of 21 general education credits as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>6.00 credits in natural science (NATS)</li>
	<li>a 9.00 credit approved general education course in the social science or humanities categories</li>
	<li>a 6.00 credit approved general education course in the opposite category to the 9.00 credit course in social science or humanities already taken</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Major credits: </strong>Professional Writing program students will take 48 credits in the major, including the following:</p>

<h4>(i) Program core courses:</h4>

<h5>1000-level (9 credits)</h5>

            <div><p>There are two points of admission to the Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) degree: 1) direct entry and 2) post degree. The Bachelor of Social Work program prepares students for professional social work. Successful practice experience is an essential requirement in the social work degree program. Students integrate theory with practice by completing a 700 hour placement at an agency setting supervised by an experienced and qualified Field Instructor ( AP/SOWK 4000 6.00 and AP/SOWK 4001 6.00). The placement is intended to prepare students to function as professional social workers upon graduation. Students will be assigned a Faculty Advisor to support them through their practicum and are required to attend integrative seminars. The practicum courses are graded as "credit/no credit."</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> AP/SOWK 4000 6.00 and AP/SOWK 4001 6.00 are exempt from the Senate Policy on Repeating Passed or Failed Courses for Academic Credit. Students may only repeat AP/SOWK 4000 6.00 and AP/SOWK 4001 6.00 with permission of the school.

<h3>York University BSW Student Professional Behaviour Policy</h3>

<p>The Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) degree is an important determinant of eligibility for registration with the Ontario College of Social Workers and Social Service Workers. Given the professional trajectory of the BSW degree, a professional standard of behaviour is expected from social work students. At issue<strong><u> </u></strong>in this policy is the protection of the public and the University's role in graduating competent professionals.</p>

<p>Progression through the BSW program at the School of Social Work at York University is contingent on students' behaviour meeting the ethical and behavioural standards set forth in the Canadian Association of Social Workers Code of Ethics (CASW), the Ontario College of Social Workers and Social Service Workers Standards of Practice, the York University Student Code of Conduct, and other relevant York University policies including but not limited to the Sexual Harassment Policy and the Policy Concerning Racism.</p>

<p>This policy recognizes the general responsibility of the faculty members of the School of Social Work to foster acceptable standards of professional behaviour and of the student to be mindful of and abide by such standards.</p>

<h4>Behaviour that may Result in Withdrawal from the BSW Program</h4>

<p>A student may be withdrawn from the BSW program if the student:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Commits any breach of the CASW Code of Ethics, the Ontario College of Social Workers and Social Service Workers Standards of Practice, and/or any York University Policy that relates to student behaviour, such as the York University Student Code of Conduct or the Senate Policy on Academic Honesty that would engage the behavioural and ethical standards of the profession;</li>
	<li>Engages in any proscribed behaviour in a practicum agency as detailed in the School of Social Work's Practicum Manual;</li>
	<li>Acquires a criminal conviction after being admitted to the program (or which was acquired prior to admission but became known only after having been admitted to the program) which jeopardizes the student's ability to gain registration as a social worker; or</li>
	<li>Engages in behaviour that impairs the performance of professional responsibilities.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Jurisdiction</h4>

<p>Allegations of a breach of professional behavioural or ethical standards by a student enrolled in the BSW degree program offered by the School of Social Work, York University shall be dealt with by the School of Social Work, York University in accordance with approved procedures.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> behavioural policy procedure information is available at <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/laps/sowk/academic-resources/academic-handbook/">yorku.ca/laps/sowk/academic-resources/academic-handbook/</a>.</p>

	<li>The student's performance is judged to disrupt the functioning of the practicum site and/or jeopardize the well-being of clients of the practicum site, and/or demonstrates unprofessional behaviour at the practicum site.</li>

            <div><p>Spanish is the third most spoken language in the world. The Spanish program studies the language, literatures and linguistics of Spain and Spanish America. Students undertake intensive training in listening, reading, writing, and speaking, while discovering the Spanish-speaking world's social and cultural context. Spanish courses cover a wide variety of topics: the 900-year literary tradition of Spain; the innovative work of Latin America's writers; and the social, historical, and pedagogical aspects of Spanish linguistics. Qualified bilingual graduates are sought after in national and international law, business and finance, the media, social services, healthcare, education, hospitality and the environment.</p>

<p>Spanish program students can communicate in a major international language and are familiar with the culture of the Spanish-speaking world. As a specialization, major, part of a double major or a minor, Spanish is an ideal match with any program in the humanities or social sciences; it also complements programs in professional studies and the natural and physical sciences.</p>

<p>Spanish program students may engage in enhancing co-curricular opportunities such as experience with literary writing and publishing; connections with the local and academic communities in our lecture series and with musical, literary and theatrical events; they may gain valuable research and cross-cultural skills by participating in faculty-led research projects. Students also have the opportunity to participate in exchange programs and summer internship programs in Spain and Latin America and a summer course in Spain.</p>

<p>Career options include international development; social services; education; foreign service; arts; media; national and international law, business and finance; publishing; hospitality.</p>

<p>The Spanish Program offers the full range of degree options. Students may opt for a Specialized Honours BA, an Honours BA, a BA, an Honours Double Major, an Honours Double Major (Interdisciplinary), an Honours Major/Minor, an Honours Minor. The Department of Languages, Literatures and Linguistics also offers a Certificate of Language Proficiency in Spanish.</p>

      <div>
              <div>
            <div><p>Academic standing depends on several factors, including the number of courses a student has passed (including transfer credits), the grade point average achieved during a particular session (sessional grade point average) and the overall grade point average (cumulative grade point average).</p>

<p><strong>Change of program.</strong> Students may request to change their program of study after completion of their first academic session in the Faculty, provided they meet the minimum academic standards and entry requirements for the program requested. Students must follow requirements of the program in place at the point of entry. A Program Change Request, available on the Program Change web page at <a href="https://myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/program-change" title="http://myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/program-change">myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/program-change</a>, must be submitted. Some programs may require school/department approval. For details of individual programs, refer to the Programs of Study section. Also consult the section on Academic Standing.</p>

<h3>Bachelor of Arts (Honours BA, Honours iBA) Degrees (120 Credits)</h3>

<p><strong>Entry.</strong> Students may enter/re-enter prior to the completion of 90 credits. Some programs may have limited entry and/or further entry requirements. Some programs have mathematics entry requirements. Students should refer to the program of study section for further information on these and other requirements. Students who are ineligible to continue in Honours may re-enter Honours if they raise their cumulative grade point average to 5.00 (C+) or above by the time they have successfully completed their 90th credit.</p>

<p>Students qualify for faculty transfer to a Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies Honours program provided they have met the minimum Honours progression requirement. Students from other Faculties may submit a Program Change Request, available on the Program Change web page at <a href="https://myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/program-change" title="http://myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/program-change">myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/program-change</a>, to enter the Honours BA or Honours iBA program.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> all students who enter/re-enter the program must follow the requirements of the program in place at the time of entry/re-entry.</p>

<p><strong>Continuing in Honours.</strong> To continue in an Honours program, students must maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 5.00. Students whose cumulative grade point average falls below 5.00 during the course of their studies may proceed in an Honours program, on warning, provided they meet the year level progression requirements described below.</p>

<p><strong>Honours standing grade point average requirement.</strong> Students who have completed less than 84 earned credits whose cumulative grade point average is below 5.00 may continue in Honours provided they meet the minimum year level progression requirements as follows:</p>

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Year Level</th>
			<th>Earned Credits</th>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> year level is based on the number of earned credits including transfer credit.</p>

<p><strong>Courses taken beyond the normal maximum.</strong> Students in an Honours program who successfully complete (pass) more than 120 credits and whose cumulative grade point average is at least 5.00 will have all credits counted towards their Honours and their cumulative grade point average.</p>

<p><strong>Graduating with an Honours BA or Honours iBA degree.</strong> To graduate in an Honours program, students must successfully complete (pass) at least 120 credits which meet Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies degree and program requirements. The cumulative grade point average must be at least 5.00.</p>

<p><strong>Failure to maintain minimum Honours standing (BA, iBA).</strong> Students who do not meet the conditions outlined above may continue their studies only in a BA degree program. Students who are ineligible to continue in Honours may re-enter Honours if they raise their cumulative grade point average to 5.00 or above by the time they have successfully completed (passed) their 90th credit. No extra courses may be taken in a subsequent session in an effort to raise the grade point average to qualify for Honours. Please refer to the Academic Warnings and Penalties section.</p>

<p><strong>Opting to graduate with a BA degree (90 credits).</strong> Students who are eligible for Honours may opt to graduate in a BA program in the session in which they have completed their final course(s).</p>

<h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA) Degree (90 Credits)</h3>

<p><strong>Entry.</strong> Students may enter/re-enter prior to completion of 90 credits. Some programs may have limited entry and/or further entry requirements. Some programs have mathematics entry requirements. Students should refer to the program of study section for further information on these and other requirements.</p>

<p>Students may transfer to Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies BA degree provided they meet the minimum cumulative grade point average of 4.00.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> all students who enter/re-enter the BA program must follow the requirements of the program in place at the time of entry/re-entry. Some programs may have limited entry and/or further entry requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Continuing.</strong> Students who maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 4.00 may proceed in good standing in the BA degree. Students who at the end of an academic session meet the minimum Honours progression requirement will automatically be placed in the Honours program (if applicable). Students at the point of enrolment in a new academic session can declare via the enrolment system if they wish to proceed in the BA or Honours BA degree.</p>

<p><strong>Courses taken beyond the normal maximum.</strong> Students in a bachelor program who successfully complete (pass) more than 90 credits and whose cumulative grade point average is at least 4.00 will have all credits counted towards their cumulative grade point average.</p>

Please refer to the Academic Warnings and Penalties section.</p>

<p><strong>Additional credits to raise grade point average to qualify for graduation.</strong> Students in a BA degree who have successfully completed (passed) 90 credits in accordance with Faculty and program requirements, but whose cumulative grade point average is below 4.00, will be allowed a maximum of 12 attempted credits beyond the 90 passed credits in an effort to raise their cumulative grade point average to at least 4.00 to qualify for graduation. New courses, repeated courses, passed courses and failed courses will count towards the total maximum number of attempted credits. These courses must be taken at York University.</p>

<p>Students who have 90 passed credits and have attempted 12 credits beyond the 90, who fail to attain the minimum required cumulative grade point average of 4.00 will be ineligible to continue or graduate.</p>

<h3>Bachelor of Commerce (Honours BCom) Degree (120 Credits)</h3>

<ol>
	<li>All course grades, including those assigned after a deferred examination(s) are derived from an evaluation of examination and term work, unless otherwise decided.</li>
	<li>With the exception of courses explicitly required for certification by a professional body, or other exceptions agreed to by Senate, students pass or fail a course on the basis of final course average, without the additional requirement of having to obtain a passing grade on a final examination. (This does not preclude the possibility of a final examination representing more than 50 per cent of the final grade in a particular course or the requirement that a student pass a specific course lab component.)</li>
	<li>Unless Senate agrees to explicit exemptions, eligibility to proceed in or graduate from an undergraduate degree program will not be based on a minimum grade requirement for each major course. It should be noted that this does not preclude setting requirements for a minimum cumulative grade point average in a major subject area. Nor does this preclude setting individual course grade requirements when a course is a prerequisite for upper-level courses or as part of a core requirement. Course grades are not official until released by the University.</li>
	<li>The letter-grade system is the fundamental system of assessment of performance in undergraduate programs at York University. In courses where percentages are used as a means of reporting grades on individual pieces of work, the following conversion table is to be used in converting percentage grades to letter grades, unless alternative provisions for scaling and/or conversion are announced to students in writing within the first two weeks of classes.</li>

<h4>Repeating passed or failed courses for academic credit:</h4>

<p>Students may repeat a passed or failed course twice for academic degree or certificate credit, for a maximum of three (3) attempts at a course. Students should note that course availability and space considerations may preclude the possibility of repeating a course in the session they choose.</p>

<p>Credit towards your degree will only be counted once for repeated courses taken at York or elsewhere. All repeated passed or failed attempts are subject to the University's&nbsp;<a href="/calendars/2021-2022/policy-on-repeating-passed-or-failed-courses-for-academic-credit" title="Policy on Repeating Passed or Failed Courses For Academic Credit">Policy on Repeating Passed or Failed Courses For Academic Credit</a>.</p>

<h4>Pass/Fail grading option:</h4>

<p>The Faculty wants capable upper-year students to feel free to enrol in free-choice courses without fear of jeopardizing their grade point average. For this reason, students may take a limited number of such courses for full degree credit on an ungraded basis. Courses taken on this basis are listed on the transcript as either P (pass) or F (fail). Neither of these two grades is calculated into the student’s grade point averages. Pass credits are added into the total number of credits earned and credits taken. Fail credits are added into the total number of credits failed and credits taken. The following regulations apply to courses taken as a pass/fail alternative grading option.</p>

<p>Students in good standing who have completed a minimum of 24 credits towards an undergraduate degree program may elect to take up to six credits on an ungraded basis toward a bachelors degree (90 credits) or 12 credits toward an Honours bachelors degree (120 credits). The pass/fail grading option cannot be chosen by a student for the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>major or minor courses (including for-credit practica);</li>
	<li>outside the major required courses;</li>
	<li>courses taken to satisfy general education or certificate requirements;</li>
	<li>required 1000-level science courses for students in the Faculties of Health, Science and Engineering.</li>
</ul>

<p>Students must confirm their eligibility to complete a course on an ungraded basis. Completed Pass/Fail Application forms must be submitted to the relevant office within the first two weeks of class. The completed form should then be returned to Registrarial Services.</p>

<p>Students who elect to complete a course on an ungraded basis may not revert to taking the course on a graded basis after the last date to drop a course without academic penalty.</p>

<p>The form to request the pass/fail grading option is available on the Pass/Fail Option Web page at <a href="https://myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/pass-fail-option" title="http://www.registrar.yorku.ca/enrol/passfail">myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/pass-fail-option</a>.</p>

<h4>Exceptions</h4>

<p>The pass/fail grading option is not applicable for the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>graduate degrees or diplomas;</li>
	<li>BEd and BEd (Technological Education) degrees;</li>
	<li>LLB/JD degree;</li>
	<li>BBA and iBBA degrees;</li>
	<li>exchange courses taken at another institution.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Credit/No Credit</h4>

<p>The notations Credit and No Credit will be used when an entire course is being offered on an ungraded basis. No Credit will count as an earned failing grade of F in the grade point average.</p>

<h3>Grading Scheme</h3>

<p>The course grading scheme (i.e. kinds and weights of assignments, essays, exams etc.) is to be announced, and be available in writing, within the first two weeks of classes.</p>

<p>Under normal circumstances, graded feedback worth at least 15 per cent of the final grade for fall, winter or summer term, and 30 per cent for full year courses offered in the fall/winter session, will be received by students in all courses prior to the final withdrawal date from a course without receiving a grade, with the following exceptions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>graduate or upper-level undergraduate courses where course work typically, or at the instructor’s discretion, consists of a single piece of work and/or is based predominantly (or solely) on student presentations (e.g. honours theses or graduate research papers not due by the drop date etc.);</li>
	<li>practicum courses;</li>
	<li>ungraded courses;</li>
	<li>courses in Faculties where the drop date occurs within the first three weeks of classes;</li>
	<li>courses which run on a compressed schedule (a course which accomplishes its academic credits of work at a rate of more than one credit hour per two calendar weeks or faster).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> under unusual and/or unforeseeable circumstances which disrupt the academic norm, instructors are expected to provide grading schemes and academic feedback in the spirit of these regulations, as soon as possible. Information on other policies related to grades is available from Faculties, departments and schools and the University Secretariat (<a href="https://secretariat-policies.info.yorku.ca" title="http://secretariat-policies.info.yorku.ca">secretariat-policies.info.yorku.ca</a>).</p>

<h4>Subsequent Changes</h4>

<p>In exceptional circumstances, a previously announced marking scheme for a course may be changed, but only with the unanimous consent of students; the new marking scheme must also be distributed in written form.</p>

<p>In courses where percentages are used as a means of reporting grades on individual pieces of work, the conversion table is used in converting percentage grades to letter grades, unless alternative provisions for scaling and/or conversion are announced to students in writing within the first two weeks of classes.</p>

<h3>Grade Reappraisals</h3>

<p>Please refer to the Policies and Regulations section of the Undergraduate Calendar for further information about grade reappraisals.</p>

<p>Students may, with sufficient academic grounds, request that a final grade in a course be reappraised (which may mean the review of specific pieces of tangible work). Non-academic grounds are not relevant for grade reappraisals; in such cases, students are advised to petition to their home Faculty. Students are normally expected to first contact the course director to discuss the grade received and to request that their tangible work be reviewed. Tangible work may include written, graphic, digitized, modelled, video recording or audio recording formats, but not oral work.</p>

<p>Students need to be aware that a request for a grade reappraisal may result in the original grade being raised, lowered or confirmed.</p>

<p>In the event that students are still not satisfied with the final grade <strong>or</strong> the course director is not available to review the work, they may submit in writing a formal request for a grade reappraisal to the school/department or unit in which the course is offered. The Senate approved deadline for submitting grade reappraisals is February 15 for fall term grades, June 15 for fall/winter session and winter term grades, September 30 for summer session grades or a minimum of 21 days from the release of grades, <strong>whichever is later</strong>. When a submission deadline occurs on a weekend or holiday, requests will be accepted up until the end of the next available business day. Exercising discretion about minor delays in meeting the deadline which result from slow mail delivery or extraordinary circumstances is reasonable.</p>

<h4>Grade Reappraisal Appeal</h4>

<p>Students may appeal a negative decision on a request for a reappraisal or the result of the reappraisal itself to a Faculty-level appeals committee in the Faculty in which the course is offered only on the ground of procedural irregularity.</p>

            <div><h3>Term Work</h3>

<p>Term work includes reports, assignments, presentations, essays, tests and other written work assigned in a course with the exception of final examinations.</p>

<h4>Deadline for Submission</h4>

<p>Term work must be submitted by the first day of the official examination period of the term in which the course ends. Instructors, departments and schools may, however, set earlier deadlines for the submission of term work.</p>

<h3>Tests and Examinations</h3>

<p>Tests and examinations are important parts of the educational process. They must be conducted under fair conditions which allow students to demonstrate what they have learned. Disruptions or attempts to obtain an unfair advantage are offences against academic process and carry severe penalties:&nbsp;refer to the <em>Senate Policy on Academic Honesty</em> and the <em>Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities</em> at <a href="https://secretariat-policies.info.yorku.ca" title="http://secretariat-policies.info.yorku.ca/">secretariat-policies.info.yorku.ca</a>.&nbsp;The following regulations apply to tests and examinations (<a href="https://secretariat-policies.info.yorku.ca/policies/conduct-of-examinations-policy-guidelines/" title="http://secretariat-policies.info.yorku.ca/policies/conduct-of-examinations-policy-guidelines/">secretariat-policies.info.yorku.ca/policies/conduct-of-examinations-policy-guidelines/</a>).</p>

<h4>Identification</h4>

<p>Students who are being tested or examined are required to present a valid York University photo identification card or other acceptable form of photo identification and to sign the attendance roster for the examination.</p>

<h4>Answer Booklets</h4>

<p>Answer booklets are the property of the University. Test papers, examination booklets and other answer forms remain the property of the University unless they are released by an instructor. Students may not remove them from the test or examination room without permission; nor may they possess blank examination booklets.</p>

<h4>Students’ Right to Review</h4>

<p>Students may always have the opportunity, under properly controlled conditions, to review and discuss their graded test and examination answers, but final examination answer booklets (and at the discretion of the course director, other examination booklets) remain the property of the University, and are retained by the teaching unit for a certain period of time before they are destroyed.</p>

<h3>Tests and Examinations during the Term</h3>

<h4>Restriction at End of Term</h4>

<p>No examinations or tests collectively worth more than 20 per cent of the final grade in a course will be given during the final 14 calendar days of classes in a term. The exceptions to the rule are classes which regularly meet Friday evenings or on Saturday and/or Sunday at any time, and courses offered in the compressed summer terms.</p>

<h4>Scheduling of Tests</h4>

<p>Except where testing is conducted during individual appointments which accommodate the schedules of students (e.g. individual oral interviews in language courses, individually scheduled make-up tests), tests or examinations given during the term should be held within the hours regularly scheduled for the course in question. Any exceptions must be communicated within the first two weeks of classes and on the course outline.</p>

<h4>Students’ Right of Refusal</h4>

<p>Students who are asked to write tests or examinations in contravention of the preceding two regulations may refuse to do so without academic penalty; they also have the right to raise the matter with the Chair/director of the department or the school in which the course is offered or with the dean.</p>

<h3>Formally Scheduled Examinations</h3>

<h4>Final Examination Period</h4>

<p>There is a final examination period at the end of each term. The dates and times of formally scheduled examinations are listed on the York Courses website at <a href="https://w2prod.sis.yorku.ca/Apps/WebObjects/cdm.woa/wa/curexam" title="https://w2prod.sis.yorku.ca/Apps/WebObjects/cdm.woa/wa/curexam">w2prod.sis.yorku.ca/Apps/WebObjects/cdm.woa/wa/curexam</a>. Examinations may last two or three hours.</p>

<h4>Religious Accommodation Guidelines</h4>

<p>Students who, because of religious commitment cannot write a formally scheduled examination (December and April examination periods) on the date scheduled, should contact the course instructor <strong>no later than three weeks prior to the start of the examination period</strong> to arrange an alternative examination date. A Religious Accommodation form is available for this purpose online at <a href="https://w2prod.sis.yorku.ca/Apps/WebObjects/cdm.woa/wa/regobs" title="https://w2prod.sis.yorku.ca/Apps/WebObjects/cdm.woa/wa/regobs">w2prod.sis.yorku.ca/Apps/WebObjects/cdm.woa/wa/regobs</a>.</p>

<h4>Exam Accommodation</h4>

<p>Students with disabilities requiring accommodation or students requiring accommodation for significant religious observances shall be responsible for requesting the necessary accommodation in advance of the examination period and in accordance with the recommended timelines in the relevant policies and procedures.</p>

<h4>Rewriting of Examinations</h4>

<p>The Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies has no provision for the rewriting of a final examination to improve a mark.</p>

<h4>Missed Examinations</h4>

<p>In accordance with University policy and procedure, a student who misses an examination should contact the course director and the department/school of the examination as soon as possible. A student who wishes to write a make-up examination must request deferred standing in the course. Please refer to the section on Deferred Standing/Academic Petitions and Appeals or the Deferred Standing web page at <a href="https://myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/deferred-standing" title="https://registrar.yorku.ca/exams/deferred">myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/deferred-standing</a>.</p>

<h3>Transfer Students</h3>

<p>Students who enter with prior experience at a postsecondary educational institution are enrolled in an Honours program if their prior cumulative grade point average (including failed courses) is at least the equivalent of 5.00 on the York scale. (<strong>Note:</strong> courses taken at other postsecondary institutions are not calculated as part of the student’s grade point average at York, nor do they appear on the York transcript.)</p>

<h3>Academic Standing Requirements for Visiting Students</h3>

<p>Individuals who wish to enrol in undergraduate credit courses, but who do not intend to complete a degree or a certificate may be admitted to York as a visiting student (refer to the Admissions section for more information). There are three categories of visiting students:</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
	<li>Those who hold an undergraduate degree (three-year bachelor's degree minimum) from an accredited university/university-level institution;</li>
	<li>Those who do not hold an undergraduate degree but wish to enrol in York courses to fulfill the academic, upgrading or professional development requirements of a professional designation;</li>
	<li>Those who are currently attending another recognized university and wish to take York courses on a letter of permission issued by their home institution.</li>
</ol>

<p>Repeated course legislation does not apply to visiting students but only to academic degrees and certificates. Therefore, all courses attempted or taken will count in the overall cumulative grade point average.</p>

<h4>GPA Requirement</h4>

<p>Students in categories a) and b) whose overall cumulative grade point average falls below 4.00 on at least 24 credits attempted will not be allowed to enrol in any subsequent session as visiting students. Students who are not permitted to re-enrol must apply for re-admission through the Admissions Office.</p>

<h4>Credit Limits</h4>

<p>Students in category b) who have maintained an overall cumulative grade point average of 4.00 throughout their studies and who have completed 30 credits will not be allowed to enrol in subsequent sessions and must either reactivate to proceed as visiting students or may choose to apply for admission to a degree or certificate program.</p>

<p>Visiting students admitted to the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies may:</p>

<ol start="1">
	<li>enrol in degree credit courses providing they meet the published corequisite(s) and prerequisite(s), or obtain permission of the Chair of the discipline concerned;</li>
	<li>not register in a course equivalent to one already completed.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Faculty Transfers</h3>

<p>Students who were last registered in an undergraduate degree program in another Faculty of York University and who wish to transfer to the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies must submit a Program Change Request, available on the Program Change Web page at <a href="https://myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/program-change" title="http://myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/program-change">myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/program-change</a>. Refer to the Academic Standing section for degree/program academic standing requirements.</p>

<h3>Information for Continuing Students in a Grandparented Program</h3>

<p>Students who were registered in a degree and program formerly in the Atkinson Faculty of Liberal and Professional Studies or the Faculty of Arts have been moved to the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies. Grandparenting provisions have been developed for students continuing in these degrees and programs.</p>

<p>Grandparented rules allow students to complete their studies following the rules of the programs they were in prior to the Fall/Winter 2009-2010 Session. This includes all major and degree requirements including general education requirements and upper level requirements, as well as the electives or required credits outside the major. For more information contact the Faculty's Academic Advising Services.</p>

<h3>Second or Subsequent Degrees</h3>

<p>Students who hold an undergraduate degree from an accredited institution, and who are admissible according to Faculty and University policies, may pursue a second (or subsequent) degree program in the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies.</p>

<p>Eligibility for admission and standing will be assessed according to performance in the first or subsequent degree(s). Students will be assessed as eligible for an Honours degree if they have graduated with Honours standing in their first degree. Students who are eligible for an Honours degree program will be enrolled in Honours, but may elect to graduate with a bachelor’s degree. Students admitted to an Honours degree and 90-credit bachelor program will be granted transfer credit in accordance with the University’s residency requirement. Under certain circumstances, students admitted to a 90-credit bachelor’s degree program may qualify to proceed in an Honours degree; however, the transfer credit granted upon admission will not be amended.</p>

<p>All second (and subsequent) degree candidates must meet the residency requirements and must satisfy all upper-level requirements and requirements in the major/minor subject(s). Grade point averages are calculated for students in second (or subsequent) degree programs only on the courses taken for that degree and not on courses taken to satisfy requirements for the first or subsequent degree(s).</p>

<p>Students must apply through Admissions for second and subsequent undergraduate degree(s). University residency requirements apply.</p>

<h3>Course Loads</h3>

<h4>Fall/Winter Session</h4>

<p>A full course load is defined as 30 credits during the fall/winter session. Students may take a maximum of 36 credits overall (and 18 credits per term) without petitioning. Students with substantial familial or financial responsibilities outside the University are advised to consider taking fewer courses in a session. It is recommended that students take their personal circumstances and academic standing into consideration before taking a course load of 36 credits in the fall/winter session.</p>

<h4>Summer Session</h4>

<p>A full course load is defined as 15 credits in the summer session. Students may take a maximum of 18 credits overall without petitioning. Students with substantial familial or financial responsibilities outside the University are advised to consider taking fewer courses in a session. It is recommended that students take their personal circumstances and academic standing into consideration before taking a course load of 18 credits in the summer session.</p>

<h3>Courses Taken at York University</h3>

<p>Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies degree candidates may enrol in courses offered by other York University Faculties provided they meet the publicized corequisite(s) and/or prerequisite(s). Students are responsible for ensuring that out-of-Faculty courses meet Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies degree and program requirements. Out-of-Faculty courses are credited at the level at which they are taken.</p>

<p>York University courses are also offered in Italy by the Department of Languages, Literatures and Linguistics. In addition, independent study, directed reading and thesis courses are offered by some departments/schools. Students interested in arranging such courses should inquire at the relevant department/school. Individual programs may place restrictions on the number and nature of courses taken.</p>

<h3>Cross-listed Courses</h3>

<p>Some courses in the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies are cross-listed. Cross-listed courses are offered jointly by two or more teaching units (such as departments or divisions), or teaching units in two or more different Faculties. Regardless of the offering Faculty or discipline identified by the course prefix of a cross-listed course, every offered section of a cross-listed course is substantially the same as every other and all are therefore recognized as instances of the “same” course.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Cross-listed courses may not be double counted in order to fulfill degree requirements.</li>
	<li>Cross-listed courses may not be used to fulfill degree requirements of credits required outside the major in the programs offering the cross-listing.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Letters of Permission (LOP) - Taking Courses at another University</h3>

<p>If you wish to enrol at another university (host) and have credits completed there transferred toward your York degree/certificate, you must first request a letter of permission (LOP) and receive approval from the Registrar's Office. While you are pursuing your York degree/certificate, transfer credit will not be granted for work completed at another university without the LOP. Further information is available on the Letters of Permission webpage at <a href="https://registrar.yorku.ca/enrol/lop" title="http://www.registrar.yorku.ca/enrol/lop">registrar.yorku.ca/enrol/lop</a>.</p>

<h4>Eligibility</h4>

<ul>
	<li>To be eligible for an LOP you must be pursuing a York degree and/or a certificate program.</li>
	<li>You must be in good academic standing.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Ineligibility</h4>

<p>You are ineligible for LOP consideration:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If you are a non-degree student at York (you may apply directly to the host without an LOP).</li>
	<li>An LOP will not be issued if you are on academic warning, program warning, debarment warning or academic probation.</li>
	<li>If your academic status changes after the LOP is issued and you are no longer in good standing or are ineligible to proceed in your program, the LOP will be rescinded and you will no longer be eligible for transfer credit from the host regardless of the grade achieved there.</li>
	<li>If you enrol in courses at the host other than those listed on the LOP, you will not receive transfer credit upon completion unless the Registrar's Office amends your LOP in advance.</li>
	<li>Your LOP will not be processed if there are outstanding debts on your University account.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Students' Responsibilities</h4>

<p>It is your responsibility to ensure that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You complete the Letter of Permission form and submit it along with detailed calendar course descriptions from the host institution to the Faculty/school/department best able to identify any York-based course credit exclusions or substitutes.</li>
	<li>Submit the completed form, along with the $50 non-refundable processing fee, to the Registrar's Office drop-box in the lobby of the Bennett Centre for Student Services. Approved LOPs will be sent to the host university and a copy sent to you for your records. Incomplete applications for an LOP cannot be processed and will be returned to you.</li>
	<li>Courses completed on an LOP meet your program requirements.</li>
	<li>Once you have been issued the LOP, it should be presented to the host institution's Admission Office. The host governs admission and application deadlines for students applying on an LOP.</li>
	<li>Should your enrolment/registration circumstances change; that is, the courses(s) you are requesting on an LOP is (are) not available, you must immediately contact the Faculty in order to request approval for any replacement courses. Obtain departmental approval for these changes, then notify the Registrar’s Office at <a href="mailto:lop@yorku.ca" title="lop@yorku.ca">lop@yorku.ca</a> of any enrolment changes as soon as they are made.</li>
	<li>An official transcript is forwarded to the Registrar’s Office at York University as soon as final grades are available from the host institution, refer to the deadline dates on the Letter of Permission Web page (<a href="https://registrar.yorku.ca/enrol/lop" title="http://www.registrar.yorku.ca/enrol/lop">registrar.yorku.ca/enrol/lop</a>) under the Instructions and Application tab.</li>
	<li>If you do not register or complete any of the courses for which you were issued the LOP, you must provide the Registrar’s Office with documentation from the host declaring you either did not enrol/register or that you withdrew from the course(s) without any academic penalty.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Important Notes</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Maximum number of credits you may enrol/register in an academic session including courses taken on an LOP, is 18 credits in summer or 36 credits in fall/winter (18 credits per term).</li>
	<li>You must obtain a minimum grade of C (as understood in the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies) for credit to be granted.</li>
	<li>Course credit exclusions (CCEs) are courses offered at York and the host institution that are similar enough in content that both may not be taken for degree credit. A course substitute can replace a specific York course/degree requirement. A course substitute can be a CCE but a CCE is not always a course substitute.</li>
	<li>Some York programs are subject to external accreditation or professional association requirements (e.g. practica and core courses for engineering, nursing or social work), which restrict approvals for LOPs. Please consult your Faculty school/department for details.</li>
	<li>Credit towards your degree will only be counted once for repeated courses taken at York or elsewhere. Should you repeat a course the initial grade will be replaced with the notation of “NCR-No Credit Retained”.</li>
	<li>Generic results of “Pass” or “Credit Achieved” at the host will not be accepted for transfer credit to your York degree.</li>
	<li>Transfer credit will be assessed based on the course work/requirements including in-class hours completed at the host institution and not on the course work/requirements of the York credit exclusion or substitute.</li>
	<li>Courses and grades achieved at the host are not listed on your York transcript or included in your York grade point average(s).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Audit a Course</h3>

<p>With the permission of a course director, an auditor attends classes and participates in a course in the same way as other students, but does not submit assignments or write tests or examinations. Restrictions may apply. Further information about admissibility, application procedures, courses available and fees may be obtained at Registrarial Services.</p>

<h3>Directed Reading Courses</h3>

<p>Students who are pursuing directed reading courses may do so after having successfully completed (passed) 24 credits in the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies. The Faculty provides for such independent reading courses which are subject to the guidelines of the departments and schools, and to the following regulations:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The maximum permissible number of directed reading courses depends on a student’s degree option and availability.</li>
	<li>Students in Honours programs may take 24 credits; students in a bachelors program may take 18 credits.</li>
	<li>Within their last 30 credits, students may take a maximum of 12 credits in directed reading courses.</li>
	<li>Students may take a maximum of 12 credits of directed reading courses with the same faculty member.</li>

            <div><p>Please refer to the Policies and Regulations section of the Undergraduate Calendar for further information about deferred standing, academic petitions and appeal guidelines.</p>

<h3>Deferred Standing</h3>

<h4>What is deferred standing?</h4>

<p>Deferred standing may be granted to undergraduate students who are unable to write their final examination at the scheduled time or to submit their course work by the published deadline for the submission of term work. In order to apply for deferred standing, students must complete a Final Exam/Assignment Deferred Standing Agreement Form (available at <a href="https://myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/deferred-standing">myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/deferred-standing</a>) and reach an agreement directly with the course director for an alternate final examination date or for an extension to the deadline. The Final Exam/Assignment Deferred Standing Agreement Form facilitates the setting of an alternate date for writing a final examination or submitting outstanding course work before the Faculty deadlines (<a href="https://myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/deferred-standing">myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/deferred-standing</a>). There is no provision for rewriting a final examination to improve a final grade.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When students do not or cannot write a mid-term examination (not held during the formal examination period), alternate arrangements to write the mid-term examination should be made within the duration of the course by the course director and individual student at the discretion of the course director. The Deferred Standing Agreement does not apply.</p>

<h4>What about religious accommodation for a final exam?</h4>

<p>Because of religious commitment, students who cannot write a formally scheduled final examination on the date scheduled should refer to the appropriate guidelines regarding the Religious Observance Policy and Accommodation Guidelines at <a href="https://w2prod.sis.yorku.ca/Apps/WebObjects/cdm.woa/wa/regobs" title="https://w2prod.sis.yorku.ca/Apps/WebObjects/cdm.woa/wa/regobs">w2prod.sis.yorku.ca/Apps/WebObjects/cdm.woa/wa/regobs</a>.</p>

<h4>How are deferred standings arranged?</h4>

<p>Students must make a formal request for deferred standing. This is done by approaching their course director with the printed Final Exam/Assignment Deferred Standing Agreement form to discuss the possibility of setting an alternate date for writing a final examination or for submitting outstanding course work. Students must also supply all relevant supporting documentation (as outlined on the form). Photocopies of supporting documentation are acceptable as long as the course director is able to view the original documents. <strong>It is Senate policy that "normally, requests for deferred standing must be communicated within one week following a missed examination or the last day to submit course work."</strong></p>

<p>If an instructor does not approve a request for deferred standing, students have the option of filing an academic petition. See <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/laps/decisions-petitions/academic-petitions/">yorku.ca/laps/decisions-petitions/academic-petitions/</a>.</p>

<p>Deferred standing petitions must be submitted <strong>no later than two weeks </strong>after the formal exam period has ended (final exam) or two weeks from the published deadline for the submission of term work (as concerns term tests, essays and other written term work due at the end of the term of study).</p>

<h3>Aegrotat Standing</h3>

<p>In cases where a student cannot be expected to complete the work for a course, the phrase "aegrotat standing" (from the Latin for "she/he is ill") is substituted for a grade on the transcript. Aegrotat standing is seldom granted, and only in exceptional circumstances where deferred standing or late withdrawal from the course is inappropriate.</p>

<h3>Academic Petitions</h3>

<p>The purpose of academic regulations is to allow students to develop their interests and talents to the fullest in ways consistent with the philosophy and standards of the Faculty. In establishing academic regulations, the Faculty also recognizes that instances will arise where it makes sense, in the context of a student's academic career, to waive regulations which would otherwise apply. The purpose of a student academic petition is to request an exemption from a Faculty regulation or deadline. Being unfamiliar of regulations or deadlines does not constitute a valid reason for an academic petition.</p>

<p>Students are expected to familiarize themselves with the University guidelines and principles regarding academic petitions before taking any steps which may have repercussions or affect their academic progress.</p>

<h3>Students' Responsibilities in the Academic Petition/Appeals Process</h3>

<p>The University has established regulations, procedures and deadlines through its legislative bodies to which students must adhere. Students are expected to monitor their progress in courses, taking into account their personal and academic circumstances, and to make the necessary adjustments to their workload to meet the requirements and deadlines. The University recognizes, however, that specific circumstances may justify waiving the regulations/requirements/deadlines on an individual basis. Request for a waiver of a regulation/requirement/deadline are initiated by an academic petition.</p>

<p>Students opting to initiate an academic petition should be assured that confidentiality is a hallmark of this process.</p>

<p>While it is the University's responsibility to provide students with proper information, guidance and advice, it is incumbent upon students to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>be aware of and adhere to all Faculty and program regulations, requirements and published deadlines;</li>
	<li>familiarize themselves with their Faculty's written academic petition/appeal procedures and make requests in a timely fashion;</li>
	<li>provide all documentation to support their academic petition/appeal and to do so in a timely fashion;</li>
	<li>indicate and document all their relevant circumstances upon submitting their academic petition in the first instance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please refer to the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies website under Students for further petition/appeal information and forms at <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/laps/decisions-petitions/academic-petitions/">yorku.ca/laps/decisions-petitions/academic-petitions/</a>.</p>

<h3>Petition Appeal</h3>

<p>An appeal is a written request for the alteration of the decision taken on a petition generally made to the same level but to another person, panel or committee. Appeals against decisions of the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies Committee on Student Academic Petitions will be permitted only on the grounds of:</p>

<p>a) new evidence, or</p>

<p>b) evidence of procedural irregularity in the committee's consideration of the case.</p>

            <div><p>Advising is one of the crucial activities that support student engagement and success. The Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies considers academic advising to cover a number of complementary areas related to assisting students:</p>

<ul>
	<li>select majors and courses;</li>
	<li>change majors or degrees;</li>
	<li>transferring to LA&amp;PS;</li>
	<li>ascertain whether they are meeting the Faculty's academic regulations;</li>
	<li>plan for their academic future both before and after graduation;</li>
	<li>and generally make the most of their talents and interests.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Centre for Student Success - Academic Advising Services will assist new students with the transition into their first year at York University and support them throughout the entire first year. It is responsible for providing students with the advice and information required for a successful first year experience.<br />
<br />
Advising continuing students is a shared responsibility of the Centre for Student Success, individual departments, divisions and programs of the Faculty. Students should contact these offices throughout the year for advice and information related to their academic career including academic performance and degree program requirements.<br />
<br />
Academic advisers will provide advice, guidance and support, as well as strategies and guidelines for continued educational success. They will provide accurate information of academic policies, procedures, regulations and degree requirements. They are available to answer questions and when unable to provide an answer, they will find the person who can or refer students to the appropriate resource.<br />
<br />
Advisers are available for new and continuing students from 9:00am to 6:30pm Monday to Thursday and 10:30am to 5:00pm on Fridays during fall/winter sessions.</p>

<h3>Transfer Students</h3>

<p>Students who enter with prior experience at a postsecondary educational institution are enrolled in an Honours program if their prior cumulative grade point average (including failed courses) is at least the equivalent of 5.00 on the York scale. (<strong>Note:</strong> courses taken at other postsecondary institutions are not calculated as part of the student’s grade point average at York, nor do they appear on the York transcript.)</p>

<h3>Academic Standing Requirements for Visiting Students</h3>

<p>Individuals who wish to enrol in undergraduate credit courses, but who do not intend to complete a degree or a certificate may be admitted to York as a visiting student (refer to the Admissions section for more information). There are three categories of visiting students:</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
	<li>Those who hold an undergraduate degree (three-year bachelor's degree minimum) from an accredited university/university-level institution;</li>
	<li>Those who do not hold an undergraduate degree but wish to enrol in York courses to fulfill the academic, upgrading or professional development requirements of a professional designation;</li>
	<li>Those who are currently attending another recognized university and wish to take York courses on a letter of permission issued by their home institution.</li>
</ol>

<p>Repeated course legislation does not apply to visiting students but only to academic degrees and certificates. Therefore, all courses attempted or taken will count in the overall cumulative grade point average.</p>

<h4>GPA Requirement</h4>

<p>Students in categories a) and b) whose overall cumulative grade point average falls below 4.00 on at least 24 credits attempted will not be allowed to enrol in any subsequent session as visiting students. Students who are not permitted to re-enrol must apply for re-admission through the Admissions Office.</p>

<h4>Credit Limits</h4>

<p>Students in category b) who have maintained an overall cumulative grade point average of 4.00 throughout their studies and who have completed 30 credits will not be allowed to enrol in subsequent sessions and must either reactivate to proceed as visiting students or may choose to apply for admission to a degree or certificate program.</p>

<p>Visiting students admitted to the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies may:</p>

<ol start="1">
	<li>enrol in degree credit courses providing they meet the published corequisite(s) and prerequisite(s), or obtain permission of the Chair of the discipline concerned;</li>
	<li>not register in a course equivalent to one already completed.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Faculty Transfers</h3>

<p>Students who were last registered in an undergraduate degree program in another Faculty of York University and who wish to transfer to the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies must submit a Program Change Request, available on the Program Change Web page at <a href="https://myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/program-change" title="http://myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/program-change">myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/program-change</a>. Refer to the Academic Standing section for degree/program academic standing requirements.</p>

<h3>Information for Continuing Students in a Grandparented Program</h3>

<p>Students who were registered in a degree and program formerly in the Atkinson Faculty of Liberal and Professional Studies or the Faculty of Arts have been moved to the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies. Grandparenting provisions have been developed for students continuing in these degrees and programs.</p>

<p>Grandparented rules allow students to complete their studies following the rules of the programs they were in prior to the Fall/Winter 2009-2010 Session. This includes all major and degree requirements including general education requirements and upper level requirements, as well as the electives or required credits outside the major. For more information contact the Faculty's Academic Advising Services.</p>

<h3>Second or Subsequent Degrees</h3>

<p>Students who hold an undergraduate degree from an accredited institution, and who are admissible according to Faculty and University policies, may pursue a second (or subsequent) degree program in the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies.</p>

<p>Eligibility for admission and standing will be assessed according to performance in the first or subsequent degree(s). Students will be assessed as eligible for an Honours degree if they have graduated with Honours standing in their first degree. Students who are eligible for an Honours degree program will be enrolled in Honours, but may elect to graduate with a bachelor’s degree. Students admitted to an Honours degree and 90-credit bachelor program will be granted transfer credit in accordance with the University’s residency requirement. Under certain circumstances, students admitted to a 90-credit bachelor’s degree program may qualify to proceed in an Honours degree; however, the transfer credit granted upon admission will not be amended.</p>

<p>All second (and subsequent) degree candidates must meet the residency requirements and must satisfy all upper-level requirements and requirements in the major/minor subject(s). Grade point averages are calculated for students in second (or subsequent) degree programs only on the courses taken for that degree and not on courses taken to satisfy requirements for the first or subsequent degree(s).</p>

<p>Students must apply through Admissions for second and subsequent undergraduate degree(s). University residency requirements apply.</p>

<h3>Course Loads</h3>

<h4>Fall/Winter Session</h4>

<p>A full course load is defined as 30 credits during the fall/winter session. Students may take a maximum of 36 credits overall (and 18 credits per term) without petitioning. Students with substantial familial or financial responsibilities outside the University are advised to consider taking fewer courses in a session. It is recommended that students take their personal circumstances and academic standing into consideration before taking a course load of 36 credits in the fall/winter session.</p>

<h4>Summer Session</h4>

<p>A full course load is defined as 15 credits in the summer session. Students may take a maximum of 18 credits overall without petitioning. Students with substantial familial or financial responsibilities outside the University are advised to consider taking fewer courses in a session. It is recommended that students take their personal circumstances and academic standing into consideration before taking a course load of 18 credits in the summer session.</p>

<h3>Courses Taken at York University</h3>

<p>Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies degree candidates may enrol in courses offered by other York University Faculties provided they meet the publicized corequisite(s) and/or prerequisite(s). Students are responsible for ensuring that out-of-Faculty courses meet Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies degree and program requirements. Out-of-Faculty courses are credited at the level at which they are taken.</p>

<p>York University courses are also offered in Italy by the Department of Languages, Literatures and Linguistics. In addition, independent study, directed reading and thesis courses are offered by some departments/schools. Students interested in arranging such courses should inquire at the relevant department/school. Individual programs may place restrictions on the number and nature of courses taken.</p>

<h3>Cross-listed Courses</h3>

<p>Some courses in the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies are cross-listed. Cross-listed courses are offered jointly by two or more teaching units (such as departments or divisions), or teaching units in two or more different Faculties. Regardless of the offering Faculty or discipline identified by the course prefix of a cross-listed course, every offered section of a cross-listed course is substantially the same as every other and all are therefore recognized as instances of the “same” course.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Cross-listed courses may not be double counted in order to fulfill degree requirements.</li>
	<li>Cross-listed courses may not be used to fulfill degree requirements of credits required outside the major in the programs offering the cross-listing.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Letters of Permission (LOP) - Taking Courses at another University</h3>

<p>If you wish to enrol at another university (host) and have credits completed there transferred toward your York degree/certificate, you must first request a letter of permission (LOP) and receive approval from the Registrar's Office. While you are pursuing your York degree/certificate, transfer credit will not be granted for work completed at another university without the LOP. Further information is available on the Letters of Permission webpage at <a href="https://registrar.yorku.ca/enrol/lop" title="http://www.registrar.yorku.ca/enrol/lop">registrar.yorku.ca/enrol/lop</a>.</p>

<h4>Eligibility</h4>

<ul>
	<li>To be eligible for an LOP you must be pursuing a York degree and/or a certificate program.</li>
	<li>You must be in good academic standing.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Ineligibility</h4>

<p>You are ineligible for LOP consideration:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If you are a non-degree student at York (you may apply directly to the host without an LOP).</li>
	<li>An LOP will not be issued if you are on academic warning, program warning, debarment warning or academic probation.</li>
	<li>If your academic status changes after the LOP is issued and you are no longer in good standing or are ineligible to proceed in your program, the LOP will be rescinded and you will no longer be eligible for transfer credit from the host regardless of the grade achieved there.</li>
	<li>If you enrol in courses at the host other than those listed on the LOP, you will not receive transfer credit upon completion unless the Registrar's Office amends your LOP in advance.</li>
	<li>Your LOP will not be processed if there are outstanding debts on your University account.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Students' Responsibilities</h4>

<p>It is your responsibility to ensure that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You complete the Letter of Permission form and submit it along with detailed calendar course descriptions from the host institution to the Faculty/school/department best able to identify any York-based course credit exclusions or substitutes.</li>
	<li>Submit the completed form, along with the $50 non-refundable processing fee, to the Registrar's Office drop-box in the lobby of the Bennett Centre for Student Services. Approved LOPs will be sent to the host university and a copy sent to you for your records. Incomplete applications for an LOP cannot be processed and will be returned to you.</li>
	<li>Courses completed on an LOP meet your program requirements.</li>
	<li>Once you have been issued the LOP, it should be presented to the host institution's Admission Office. The host governs admission and application deadlines for students applying on an LOP.</li>
	<li>Should your enrolment/registration circumstances change; that is, the courses(s) you are requesting on an LOP is (are) not available, you must immediately contact the Faculty in order to request approval for any replacement courses. Obtain departmental approval for these changes, then notify the Registrar’s Office at <a href="mailto:lop@yorku.ca" title="lop@yorku.ca">lop@yorku.ca</a> of any enrolment changes as soon as they are made.</li>
	<li>An official transcript is forwarded to the Registrar’s Office at York University as soon as final grades are available from the host institution, refer to the deadline dates on the Letter of Permission Web page (<a href="https://registrar.yorku.ca/enrol/lop" title="http://www.registrar.yorku.ca/enrol/lop">registrar.yorku.ca/enrol/lop</a>) under the Instructions and Application tab.</li>
	<li>If you do not register or complete any of the courses for which you were issued the LOP, you must provide the Registrar’s Office with documentation from the host declaring you either did not enrol/register or that you withdrew from the course(s) without any academic penalty.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Important Notes</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Maximum number of credits you may enrol/register in an academic session including courses taken on an LOP, is 18 credits in summer or 36 credits in fall/winter (18 credits per term).</li>
	<li>You must obtain a minimum grade of C (as understood in the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies) for credit to be granted.</li>
	<li>Course credit exclusions (CCEs) are courses offered at York and the host institution that are similar enough in content that both may not be taken for degree credit. A course substitute can replace a specific York course/degree requirement. A course substitute can be a CCE but a CCE is not always a course substitute.</li>
	<li>Some York programs are subject to external accreditation or professional association requirements (e.g. practica and core courses for engineering, nursing or social work), which restrict approvals for LOPs. Please consult your Faculty school/department for details.</li>
	<li>Credit towards your degree will only be counted once for repeated courses taken at York or elsewhere. Should you repeat a course the initial grade will be replaced with the notation of “NCR-No Credit Retained”.</li>
	<li>Generic results of “Pass” or “Credit Achieved” at the host will not be accepted for transfer credit to your York degree.</li>
	<li>Transfer credit will be assessed based on the course work/requirements including in-class hours completed at the host institution and not on the course work/requirements of the York credit exclusion or substitute.</li>
	<li>Courses and grades achieved at the host are not listed on your York transcript or included in your York grade point average(s).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Audit a Course</h3>

<p>With the permission of a course director, an auditor attends classes and participates in a course in the same way as other students, but does not submit assignments or write tests or examinations. Restrictions may apply. Further information about admissibility, application procedures, courses available and fees may be obtained at Registrarial Services.</p>

<h3>Directed Reading Courses</h3>

<p>Students who are pursuing directed reading courses may do so after having successfully completed (passed) 24 credits in the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies. The Faculty provides for such independent reading courses which are subject to the guidelines of the departments and schools, and to the following regulations:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The maximum permissible number of directed reading courses depends on a student’s degree option and availability.</li>
	<li>Students in Honours programs may take 24 credits; students in a bachelors program may take 18 credits.</li>
	<li>Within their last 30 credits, students may take a maximum of 12 credits in directed reading courses.</li>
	<li>Students may take a maximum of 12 credits of directed reading courses with the same faculty member.</li>
</ul>

	<li>note and observe deadlines and procedures, especially deadlines for adding and dropping courses;</li>
	<li>ensure full documentation is provided in support of petitions and other requests for special consideration;</li>
	<li>keep themselves informed about their academic progress, including their performance in individual courses;</li>
	<li>ensure they are familiar with the University Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities (oscr.students.yorku.ca/student-conduct);</li>
