            <div><p><a href="https://www.yorku.ca/health/globalhealth/"><b>School of Global Health </b></a></p>

<p>Global health challenges, including chronic and communicable diseases, do not recognize borders. Public health crises or disease outbreaks in a remote part of Africa or South Asia, for example, could reach and threaten the health and well-being of people in Canada or other parts of the globe within days, if not hours. Moreover, the health of the world's population is intertwined with broader issues, including wealth disparity, environmental degradation, government policy and human rights.</p>

<p>York's Global Health degree (BA and BSc), in the Faculty of Health, examines these and many other issues with a focus on preparing the next generation of health leaders with the knowledge and skills to improve health for people worldwide by helping to create conditions that allow for greater health equity. This undergraduate degree program, the first of its kind in Canada, aims to produce agents of change who will fulfil leadership and advocacy positions in education, research, health systems, and business in both the public and private sectors locally, nationally and internationally.</p>

<p>The Global Health program offers courses leading to BA or BSc degree (Specialized Honours, Honours and Bachelor options). The Global Health BA/BSc degree will allow students to meet the requirements for post-secondary admission to professional schools and graduate programs.</p>

<p>Students in the BA/BSc Specialized Honours Global Health (120 credits) degree programs are required to take major courses worth 60 credits. In addition, students must choose a stream where an additional minimum of 21 credits from required elective courses must be completed. There are four streams: global health promotion and disease prevention; global health policy, systems and management; global e-health; and global health and the environment. In the final year of study, students complete an 11-week practicum course in a setting relevant to their stream. This hands-on experience can be completed either within the Greater Toronto Area, or elsewhere in Canada, or internationally.</p>

<p>Students in the Honours BA/BSc Global Health (120 credits) degree program are required to take major courses worth 48 credits. In this program, students have the option of completing an Honours Double Major or an Honours Major and Minor.</p>

<p>A Minor in Global Health consisting of core courses worth 30 credits (but not more than 42 credits) is offered to students whose degree program allows completion of a Minor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.yorku.ca/health/shpm/"><b>School of Health Policy &amp; Management </b></a><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>The Health Studies program explores how and why our health care system must continually renew itself. The program develops students' understanding and analytic skills in becoming future leaders with vision and innovative edge. The School of Health Policy and Management offers a broad perspective on all aspects of the health care system and fosters an understanding of how the broad determinants of health such, as income and ethnicity, influence the health of Canadians. The faculty in the school are internationally recognized for their research and teaching.</p>

<p>The Specialized Honours program in Health Policy, Management, and Digital Health meets the growing demand for Health Studies graduates who have an inter-disciplinary understanding of these three program areas and are therefore well versed in the growing interconnectedness and complexity that increasingly characterizes health systems. The Specialized Honours program emphasizes the social, political and economic organization of society as it impacts health outcomes and health care, the diverse social and health care needs of Canadians, the role of communities, and equity and social justice as integral considerations in the development of effective health care models and systems.</p>

<p>Health Policy provides a strong interdisciplinary theoretical foundation drawing from political science, political economy, law, sociology, gender studies, and ethics to critically assess social, cultural and health systems and contribute to policy research, development and implementation at all levels of society and within health systems. Health Management provides a systems approach to understanding the organization and delivery of healthcare as well as how to approach problem solving and decision making to improve quality, safety, effectiveness, and equity in health systems. Digital Health provides a theory and application-based education in information management, digital health solutions, interoperable health information systems, and current debates in health informatics and digital health to support leading edge health systems.</p>

<p>The 120-credit Honours BHS program offers a unique approach to health systems education. The programs emphasize the organization of health care and other systems, the diversity of Canadians, the role of communities, and fairness and social justice as integral considerations in the development of effective health care models by incorporating a determinant of health approach. These concerns are incorporated into the study of the most recent developments in management practice, health planning, and use of information in health care.</p>

<p>The 120-credit Honours BHS program allows students to complete pre-med and other pre-health professional course requirements. In addition, students can do a double major or major-minor in conjunction with many other York programs. The School of Health Policy and Management offers an Honours BHS program in Health Studies and Specialized Honours BHS degree in Health Policy, Management, and Digital Health. Also available is an Honours Minor program in Health Policy, Management, and Digital Health and a Cross-Disciplinary Certificate in Digital Health as well as a Professional Certificate in Health Services Financial Management.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.yorku.ca/health/kinesiology/"><b>School of Kinesiology &amp; Health Science </b></a><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Kinesiology and Health Science is the study of physical activity and its importance for human health, health science and society. The program addresses the continuum of human movement from the cellular level to the whole body. The curriculum presents broad and flexible offerings to the student. All students take a core of required courses encompassing the major areas of emphasis in kinesiology and health science. The core academic required courses include, biomechanics, exercise physiology, fitness and health, human anatomy, human physiology nutrition, psychology of physical activity, research methods and statistics, and sociocultural perspectives. Students may choose from a variety of academic elective courses to develop a highly specialized area of interest or to obtain a more general and broad program of study. The academic program combines lectures, experiential laboratories, tutorials and field experiences, thereby coupling theory and technical knowledge with applied experiences. Students can apply for specialized certifications in the areas of <a href="https://calendars.students.yorku.ca/academic-calendar#/programs/HJ7Bzbdm_/HyK4TAl4O?searchTerm=athletic%20therapy&amp;bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Certificate%20in%20Athletic%20Therapy&amp;bcItemType=programs">athletic therapy</a>, and <a href="https://calendars.students.yorku.ca/academic-calendar#/programs/HJ7Bzbdm_/Bk1KMyZVO?searchTerm=fitness%20assessment%20and%20exercise%20counselling.&amp;bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Certificate%20in%20Fitness%20Assessment%20and%20Exercise%20Counselling&amp;bcItemType=programs">fitness assessment and exercise counselling</a>.</p>

<p>A physical activity skills "practicum" program is an integral part of the undergraduate program in Kinesiology and Health Science. Students take one practicum course in each of the following six areas: dance/gymnastics, aquatics, team sports, individual and dual sports, track and field, and emergency care, plus two elective courses from the large variety of practicum courses offered.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.yorku.ca/health/nursing/"><b>School of Nursing </b></a><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>The Bachelor of Science in nursing (BScN Honours) degree focuses on the development of the theoretical, scientific and philosophical knowledge. The role of nurses, through relational practice and by promoting and preserving health and well-being, is emphasized through both theory and self-reflective practicum experiences. Graduates will be prepared to practise collaboratively in a variety of settings to enhance individual, family, community and global health.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.yorku.ca/health/psychology/"><b>Department of Psychology </b></a><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>The Department of Psychology offers a curriculum spanning introductory to advanced-level courses. BA and BSc degrees are offered and programs include 3 year 90 credit, 4 year Honours, and 4 year Specialized Honours.</p>

<p>The Department of Psychology offers a curriculum which begins with a broad introductory survey of the various areas of enquiry within the discipline of psychology and the various applications of psychological knowledge. Insofar as possible, courses are offered in multiple sections with alternative formats so that students may select the format which most nearly meets their needs. It is the intention of the Department of Psychology to serve the needs of students whose interests in the discipline range from curiosity to commitment.</p>

<p>Second year courses provide foundational knowledge in contemporary psychology, statistics and methodology, and writing in psychology. The intermediate level of the curriculum then provides choice from a wide range of courses which examine areas of psychology in greater depth. At the advanced level, courses are typically offered in seminars. Students are encouraged to select a wide range of courses and a high degree of flexibility is possible within the programs offered. For specific program requirements please consult the Faculty of Health Programs of Study section.</p>

<h3>Interdisciplinary Program</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.yorku.ca/interdisciplinary/neuroscience/"><b>Neuroscience</b></a></p>

<p>A brain or nervous system illness or injury will affect one in three Canadians in their lifetime. Understanding the brain and nervous system to address neurological and mental health disorders is one of the most pressing scientific challenges of our time.</p>

<p>The interdisciplinary nature of York’s undergraduate program gives students access to renowned researchers working in many different areas of neuroscience. The program’s small size encourages collaboration amongst students, faculty members, and community partners as they investigate the development, structure, and function of the nervous system including the ways it can change – whether naturally or through human intervention.</p>

<p>York’s undergraduate Neuroscience program has several unique features. Based on their interests, students choose one of three entry pathways by selecting Biology, Kinesiology &amp; Health Science, or Psychology as their home program. The adventure begins with a solid science curriculum in first year, including the keystone course Frontiers in Neuroscience.</p>

<p>Each year then builds on the successes of the prior year. Students experience a broad neuroscience foundation in second year. In third year, they develop their understanding by choosing courses from the three specialization streams (cellular/molecular, cognitive/behavioural, or systems neuroscience), and put it all together with a stimulating, research-based capstone course in fourth year.</p>

<p>The grading scheme in courses (such as kinds and weights of assignments, essays, exams etc.) will be announced, and will be available in writing, within the first two weeks of class.</p>

<h3>Graded Feedback (Marks on Assignments, Essays and Tests)</h3>

<p>Under normal circumstances, you will receive graded feedback worth at least 15% of the final grade for the fall, winter or summer session, and 30% for full-year courses offered in the fall/winter session, before the final withdrawal (drop) date from a course without receiving a grade, with the following exceptions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Graduate or upper-level undergraduate courses in which coursework typically, or at the instructor’s discretion, consists of a single piece of work and/or is based predominantly (or solely) on student presentations (e.g. Honours thesis or graduate research papers not due by the drop date etc.)</li>
	<li>Practicum courses</li>
	<li>Ungraded courses</li>
	<li>Courses in Faculties where the drop date occurs within the first three weeks of classes</li>
	<li>Courses that run on a compressed schedule (a course that accomplishes its academic credits of work at a rate of more than one credit hour per two calendar weeks)</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> <i>Under unusual and/or unforeseeable circumstances that disrupt the academic norm, instructors are expected to provide grading schemes and academic feedback in the spirit of these regulations, as soon as possible.</i></p>

<p>The receipt of graded feedback in advance of withdrawal (drop) deadlines will allow you to monitor your own progress in individual courses and provide the basis for you to make sound academic decisions about adding and dropping courses by the deadline. <u>If you do not officially withdraw (drop) from the course by the deadline (using the online registration and enrolment system), you will receive a grade for the course.</u> Failure to attend the course does not constitute withdrawal (or drop). Review at the Current Students Web site for further information.</p>

<h3>End-of-Term Percentage Restriction</h3>

<p>No examinations or tests collectively worth more than 20 per cent of the final grade in a course will be given during the final 14 calendar days of classes in a term. The exceptions to the rule are classes that regularly meet on Friday evenings or on Saturday and/or Sunday at any time, and courses offered in the compressed summer terms.</p>

<p>During the summer session, students may take a maximum of 15 credits. Students with substantial family or financial responsibilities outside the University are advised to consider taking fewer courses in a session.</p>

<h3>Residency Requirement</h3>

<p>A minimum of 30 course credits and at least half (50 per cent) of the course credits required in each undergraduate degree program major/minor must be taken at York University.</p>

<h3>Coregistration in the Faculty of Education</h3>

<p>Students enrolled in the bachelor of arts or bachelor of science degrees offered by the Faculty of Health may apply for admission to the Pre-Service Concurrent program of the Faculty of Education. If they are accepted, they may coregister in the Faculty of Education and upon successful completion of the separate degree requirements of both Faculties will be awarded two degrees:</p>

<ul>
	<li>an Honours bachelor of arts (BA) and a bachelor of education (BEd) or</li>
	<li>a bachelor of arts (BA) and a bachelor of education (BEd) or</li>
	<li>an Honours bachelor of science (BSc) and a bachelor of education (BEd) or</li>
	<li>a bachelor of science (BSc) and a bachelor of education (BEd)</li>
	<li>a bachelor of arts (BA) in education studies</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the health and education courses are taken concurrently, they are counted separately by each Faculty. Grade point averages for courses in the two Faculties are also calculated separately. Thus, the 30 credits required for the BEd are independent of the 120 credits required for an Honours BA or BSc, or the 90 credits required for the BA or BSc. A student completing the requirements for both degrees would therefore complete a total of 150 credits for the Honours BA/BEd or Honours BSc/BEd or 120 credits for the BA/BEd or BSc/BEd.</p>

<h3>Guidelines for Faculty of Health Supervised Independent Study Courses</h3>

<p>Students may wish to pursue intensive work with a particular faculty member on a topic of study not offered in a particular academic session. The Faculty of Health provides for such independent study courses which can be based on library research, including critical literature review, or on an empirical piece of research. Independent study courses are subject to the guidelines of the schools and department and to the following Faculty regulations:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Students may take independent study courses only after having successfully completed 24 credits at York University.</li>
	<li>The maximum permissible number of independent study courses depends on a student's program type. Students in Honours BA, BSc, BScN or BHS programs may take 24 such credits; students in bachelor programs may take 18 such credits.</li>
	<li>Within their last 30 credits, students may take a maximum of 12 credits in independent study courses.</li>
	<li>Students may take a maximum of 12 credits of independent study courses with the same faculty member.</li>
	<li>The student and the faculty member must agree on a written description of the course, its content, the learning outcomes and evaluation scheme in relation to the overall degree level expectations. Agreed upon course descriptions are submitted to the appropriate unit body for approval.</li>
	<li>Copies of approved course descriptions must be deposited with that unit. The student and faculty member should each retain a copy.</li>

<p>School of Nursing: Policy on Involuntary Withdrawal</p>

<p>A student may be required to withdraw involuntarily from a course with a practicum component if:</p>

<ol>
	<li>the student fails to meet the requirements of the course with a practicum component, either through unsatisfactory attendance and/or participation in class or practicum settings, or through unprofessional behaviour in fulfilling course requirements; or</li>
	<li>the student's performance is judged to disrupt the functioning of the practicum site and/or jeopardize the well-being of clients of the practicum site, and/or demonstrate failure to meet professional standards for practice currently mandated by the College of Nurses of Ontario.</li>
</ol>

<p>Following a meeting with the student, the decision to require the student to withdraw will be taken by the director of the School of Nursing on the recommendation of the course director and/or practicum coordinator.</p>

<p>Students have access to the usual appeal procedures in such instances.</p>

            <div>School of Nursing: Student Behaviour Policy</div>
      </h3>	<div class="content">
		
      <div>
              <div>
            <div><p>The Bachelor of Science in nursing (BScN) degree is an important determinant of eligibility for registration with the College of Nurses of Ontario. Given the professional trajectory of the BScN degree, a professional standard of behaviour is expected from nursing students. At issue in this policy is the protection of the public and the University's role in graduating competent professionals. The policy recognizes the general responsibility of the faculty members of the School of Nursing to foster acceptable standards of professional behaviour and of the student to be mindful of and abide by such standards.</p>

<p>Progression through the BScN program at the School of Nursing at York University is contingent on students' behaviour meeting the ethical and behavioural standards set forth in the Canadian Nurses Association Code of Ethics for Registered Nurses, the College of Nurses of Ontario Professional Standards, including the Ethics Practice Standard, the York University Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities, and other relevant York University policies including, but not limited to, the Sexual Harassment Policy and the Policy Concerning Racism. Behaviour that may result in withdrawal from the BScN program.</p>

<p>A student may be withdrawn from the BScN program if he or she:</p>

<ol>
	<li>commits any breach of the CNA Code of Ethics, the CNO Professional Standards, the CNO Ethics Practice Standards and/or any York University Policy that relates to student behaviour, such as the York University Student Code of Conduct or the Senate Policy on Academic Honesty that would engage the behavioural and ethical standards of the profession;</li>
	<li>engages in any proscribed behaviour in a practicum agency as detailed in the School of Nursing's Handbook;</li>
	<li>acquires a criminal conviction after being admitted to the program (or which was acquired prior to admission but became known only after having been admitted to the program) which jeopardizes the student's ability to gain registration as a nurse; or</li>
	<li>engages in behaviour that impairs the performance of professional responsibilities.</li>

<h4>School of Nursing: Length of Completion of 2nd Entry and Post-RN Internationally Educated Nurses BScN Programs Policy</h4>

<p>This policy defines time limitations for program completion for the 2nd Entry and Post RN Internationally Educated Nurses BScN programs. Time limitations are important to ensure cohesion and continuity of content, current competence and associated patient safety within the context of professional nursing education. Please refer to the&nbsp;<i>Policy for Undergraduate Nursing Student Leave of Absence</i>&nbsp;for other related information.</p>

<p>These time limitations take into account the programs' compressed structures and plans of study, as well as the frequency of course offerings, and the degree to which nursing knowledge and practice change over time.</p>

<h5>Guidelines</h5>

<p><b>1. Length of completion of programs</b></p>

<p><b>1.1.</b>&nbsp;The 2nd Entry BScN program is a two-year full-time program (6 consecutive terms*). Students normally must complete this program within four (4) years (12 terms) from the time of admission.</p>

<p><b>1.2.</b>&nbsp;The Post-RN Internationally Educated Nurses (IEN) BScN program is a five (5) term full-time program. Students normally must complete the IEN program within four (4) years (12 terms) from the time of admission.</p>

<p>*Undergraduate students may only register within a "session" (i.e. Fall/Winter and Summer) as opposed to a "term", and exit decisions from a program can only be determined at the end of a session. All exit decisions must be made coincident with the completion of course work in any given session. Since Nursing students may be concurrently enrolled in courses that span a full session (6 credits) and that are completed in one term (3 credits), discretion regarding the timing of a final decision on student progress, exit from the program or leave of absence may be necessary. The School of Nursing will ensure registration and exit decisions are communicated to the Registrar's Office for application to a student's record at the end of the relevant academic session.</p>

<p><b>2. Unsuccessful completion of program requirements within the designated timeframe</b></p>

<p><b>2.1.</b>&nbsp;A student who is unsuccessful in completing the program requirements within the designated timeframe, notwithstanding approved leaves under the&nbsp;<i>Policy for Undergraduate Nursing Student Leave of Absence</i>, must withdraw from their nursing program. If a student is not able to complete the program within the required timeframe, the exit reason will be coded as:&nbsp;<i>"Ineligible to Continue or Graduate"</i>.</p>

<p><b>2.2.</b>&nbsp;The student may apply to be reinstated to the program, in light of extraordinary extenuating circumstances, for instance, severe illness or personal loss. Reinstatement may require clinical or academic remediation as per the individual student's standing in the program.</p>

<p><b>2.3.</b>&nbsp;Students who are with withdrawn from a nursing program on the basis of exceeding the time limitations for program completion may pursue admission or transfer to another degree program at the University.</p>

<h4>School of Nursing: Policy on the Length of Completion of York-Seneca-Georgian BScN Program</h4>

<p>This policy defines time limitations for program completion for the Collaborative BScN program. Time limitations are important to ensure cohesion and continuity of content, current competence and associated patient safety within the context of professional nursing education. These time limitations take into account the program's collaborative structure and plans of study, the transition of the BScN student to a second campus, as well as the frequency of course offerings, the length of completion requirements in other York BScN programs, and the degree to which nursing knowledge and practice change over time. Refer to the current Policy for Undergraduate Nursing Student Leave of Absence for other related information.</p>

<h5>Guidelines</h5>

<p><b>1. Length of completion of programs</b></p>

<p><b>1.1.</b>&nbsp;The Collaborative BScN program is a four-year full-time program (eleven terms*). The first two years of the program are completed at one of the College partners, and the last two years are completed at the School of Nursing at York University. Students normally must complete this program within six (6) calendar years (18 terms) from the time of admission.</p>

<p><b>1.2.</b>&nbsp;Students taking longer than two (2) calendar years to complete the first two program years of the Collaborative BScN degree at the College, notwithstanding approved leaves under the Policy for Undergraduate Nursing Student Leave of Absence, will be advised by the relevant College in writing of the length of time remaining to complete the program prior to transferring to year three of the program at York University. Before each new academic session, the Colleges shall notify the School of Nursing at York University of any such students.</p>

<p>*Undergraduate students may only register within a "session" (i.e., Fall/Winter and Summer) as opposed to a "term", and exit decisions from a program can only be determined at the end of a session. All exit decisions must be made coincident with the completion of course work in any given session. Since nursing students may be concurrently enrolled in courses that both span a full session (6 credits) and which are completed in one term (3 credits), discretion regarding the timing of a final decision on student progress and/or exit may be necessary. The School of Nursing will ensure registration and exit decisions are communicated to the Registrar's Office for application to a student's record at the end of the relevant academic session.</p>

<p><b>2. Unsuccessful completion of program requirements within the designated timeframe</b></p>

<p><b>2.1.</b>&nbsp;A student who is unsuccessful in completing the program requirements within the designated timeframe, notwithstanding approved leaves under the&nbsp;<i>Policy for Undergraduate Nursing Student Leave of Absence</i>, must withdraw from their nursing program. If a student is not able to complete the program within the required timeframe, the exit reason will be coded as:&nbsp;<i>"Ineligible to Continue or Graduate"</i>.</p>

<p><b>2.2.</b>&nbsp;The student may apply to be reinstated to the program, in light of extraordinary extenuating circumstances, for instance, severe illness or personal loss. Reinstatement may require clinical or academic remediation as per the individual student's standing in the program.</p>

<p><b>2.3.</b>&nbsp;Students who are with withdrawn from a nursing program on the basis of exceeding the time limitations for program completion may pursue admission or transfer to another degree program at the University.</p>

<h4>School of Nursing: Undergraduate Student Leave of Absence Policy</h4>

<p>This policy for all undergraduate nursing students provides guidelines for absences taken while enrolled in the nursing program. Please refer to the Policy Regarding Length of Completion of 2nd Entry and Post-RN Internationally Educated Nurses BScN Programs for other related information.</p>

<h5>Guidelines:</h5>

<p><b>1. Short-Term Absences from On-Campus and Off-Campus Clinical Activities</b></p>

<p><b>1.1</b>&nbsp;Short-term absences are defined as those that range from one day or less, to 2 weeks. All absences from educational activities deemed mandatory (i.e. on-campus clinical activities, off-campus clinical placements) must be approved by the Course Director (CD) and Clinical Course Director (CCD). An unexcused absence will be considered to be a breach of professional conduct, and will documented and brought to the attention of the Course Director (CD) and Undergraduate Program Director/Coordinator (UPD). Possible consequences may involve withdrawal from the clinical activity, or course failure.</p>

<p><b>1.2</b>&nbsp;Students will be responsible for making up the missed clinical hours as arranged by the CCD, in collaboration with the CD, the Nursing Placement Coordination Office and/or Nursing Resource Centre, as applies. This will be scheduled at the discretion of the CCD and/or preceptor. Consequences of not making up missed clinical hours may result in course failure. Completion of course requirements ensures achievement of course goals and patient safety as the student progresses in the program.</p>

<p><b>1.3</b>&nbsp;An absence of two weeks due to an incomplete Clinical Preparedness Permit will result in course withdrawal.</p>

<p><b>1.4</b>&nbsp;For absences that occur due to illness, a Student Medical Certificate is required to support the medical reason. For absences that occur due to other circumstances (i.e. personal loss), relevant and acceptable documentation of the circumstance may be required. Documentation will be forwarded by the CD/CCD to the UPD for filing.</p>

<p><b>1.5</b>&nbsp;Emergency and extraordinary circumstances will be addressed on an individual basis. In all other foreseen or planned absences from clinical activities (i.e. religious holidays), students must initiate a request within the first two weeks of the term in writing for an advanced approved absence from their CD.</p>

<p><b>1.6</b>&nbsp;Students who are absent from on-campus or off-campus clinical activities for a period ranging from greater than 2 weeks to less than one term should consult immediately with the UPD to discuss progression in the course and program.</p>

<p><b>2. Absences from Non-Clinical Nursing Courses</b>For any absences from non-clinical nursing courses, please refer to Faculty of Health and University procedures and Deferred Standing Agreements.</p>

<p><b>3. Long-Term Absences from the Program</b></p>

<p><b>3.1. Leave for Serious Illness or Exceptional Circumstance</b></p>

<p><b>3.1.1.</b>&nbsp;Long term absences are defined as those that are at least one term** long. Students are required to apply in writing to the UPD for absences up to three (3) terms (one calendar year), on the grounds of serious health or personal circumstances which temporarily make it impossible for a student to continue in the program. The student must complete the Leave of Absence Request Form no later than 15 calendar days after start of the current term for a planned leave of absence and submit it to the UPD for approval; other timelines will be considered in extenuating circumstances. This approval will be made in consultation with the School's Undergraduate Program Committee or designated subcommittee. Should a student's request be denied, the student has the right to submit a petition to the Faculty of Health.</p>

<p><b>3.1.2.</b>&nbsp;Leaves of absence granted on the basis of a serious health problem required submission of a completed Student Medical Certificate. A certificate may also be required to indicate that the student is able to resume studies.</p>

<p><b>3.1.3.</b>&nbsp;All students who have been absent from the program must meet with the UPD before re-entering into the program. It is the student's responsibility to demonstrate eligibility to return to clinical course activity, in consultation with the UPD. This may involve some clinical remediation as per the individual student's academic needs. The completion date of the student's degree program will be extended by the duration of the leave taken, up to the maximum time allowed for completion of their program. Please refer to the&nbsp;<i>Policy Regarding Length of Completion of 2nd Entry and Post-RN Internationally Educated Nurses BScN Programs</i>&nbsp;for additional information. Students returning to clinical courses after a long term absence may be placed on a waiting list for placement. All efforts will be made to place these students.</p>

<p><b>3.1.4.</b>&nbsp;Once on leave of absence, a student is not registered in the Undergraduate Nursing Program and is not required to pay fees. The coding of the registration status for students who are approved for a Leave of Absence by the School of Nursing in the Faculty of Health will be "Registered as Inactive". While on a leave, students will not attend courses or engage in any coursework. Depending on when the leave begins, a student may retain access to resources of the University, such as using library facilities or computing resources for the remainder of the Session only.</p>

<p>**Undergraduate students may only register within a&nbsp;<b>session</b>&nbsp;(i.e., Fall/Winter and Summer) as opposed to a&nbsp;<b>term</b>, and exit decisions from a program can only be determined at the end of a session. All exit decisions must be made coincident with the completion of course work in any given session. Since Nursing students may be concurrently enrolled in courses that both span a full session (6 credits) and are completed in one term (3 credits), discretion regarding the timing of a final decision on student progress and/or exit may be necessary. The School of Nursing will ensure registration and exit decisions are communicated to the Registrar's Office for application to a student's record at the end of the relevant academic session.</p>

<p><b>3.2. Parental Leave</b></p>

<p><b>3.2.1.</b>&nbsp;The School of Nursing acknowledges the need for individuals to have special arrangements made during their educational program for the purpose of pregnancy/parental leave. The School of Nursing supports a student's decision to take up to a full year for their pregnancy/parental leave(s).</p>

<p><b>3.2.2.</b>&nbsp;A student may request from one to three terms of leave (i.e., up to one calendar year), which must be completed within one year of the date of birth or custody, or the start of the leave. While on parental leave, a student does not register or pay fees to the University, hence will not have access to resources during that time.</p>

<p><b>3.2.3.</b>&nbsp;A student must apply for parental leave by completing the Leave of Absence Request Form. The completion date of the degree program will be extended by the duration of the leave taken, up to the maximum time allowed for completion of their program. Please refer to the&nbsp;<i>Policy Regarding Length of Completion of 2nd Entry and Post-RN Internationally Educated Nurses BScN Programs</i>&nbsp;for additional information. Normally, the start and finish of the leave would coincide with the beginning and end of term.Before re-entering, students must meet with the UPD to plan their re-entry into the program. It is the student's responsibility to demonstrate eligibility to return to clinical courses, in consultation with the UPD. This may involve some clinical remediation as per the individual student's academic needs. Students returning to clinical courses after a long term absence may be placed on a waiting list for placement. All efforts will be made to place these students.</p>

            <div><h3>Academic Standing Requirements for Visiting Students</h3>

<p>An individual who wishes to enrol in undergraduate credit courses, but who do not intend to complete a degree or a certificate may be admitted to York as a visiting student (see the Admissions section for more information). There are three categories of visiting students:</p>

<ol>
	<li>those who hold an undergraduate degree (three-year bachelor's degree minimum) from an accredited university/university-level institution;</li>
	<li>those who do not hold an undergraduate degree but wish to enrol in York courses to fulfill the academic, upgrading or professional development requirements of a professional designation;</li>
	<li>those who are currently attending another recognized university and wish to take York courses on a letter of permission issued by their home institution.</li>
</ol>

<h4><b>Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement</b></h4>

<p>Students in categories A and B whose overall cumulative grade point average (OCGPA) falls below 4.00 on at least 24 credits attempted will not be allowed to enrol in any subsequent session as visiting students. Students who are not permitted to re-enrol must apply for re-admission through the Admissions Office.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;repeated course legislation does not apply to visiting students but only to academic degrees and certificates. All courses attempted or taken, therefore, will count in the OCGPA.</p>

<h4><b>Credit Limits</b></h4>

<p>Students in category B who have maintained an OCGPA of 4.00 throughout their studies and who have completed 30 credits will not be allowed to enrol in subsequent sessions. They must either reactivate to proceed as visiting students or may choose to apply for admission to a degree or certificate program</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Limited Additional Credits for Bachelor Degree Program</h3>

<p>Students in a bachelor program who have earned 90 credits in accordance with Faculty and program requirements, but whose cumulative grade point average is below 4.00 may attempt to raise their average to 4.00 by taking up to 12 additional credits, to a maximum of 102 credits. These courses must be above the 1000 level and must be taken at York University.</p>

<h3>Petitions Committee</h3>

<p>The Faculty of Health Petitions Committee considers requests for exceptions to Faculty regulations, such as but not limited to: requests to withdraw from a course past the deadline, deferred standing to complete final exams or final assignments, and requests to continue studies without interruption from students who have been required to withdraw or debarred. The Committee will give due consideration to transition difficulties documented by students in their first university year.</p>

<p>Students in the Faculty of Health have the right to petition for special consideration of a waiver of a faculty regulation or deadline. A petition cannot be used to create legislation that does not exist (e.g. a degree program).</p>

<h3>Petition Procedures</h3>

<p>Petitions are held in the strictest confidence. The Committee considers the petition package itself, any supporting documentation from professors or medical practitioners and other relevant information contained in the student’s record. Students may not appear before the Faculty of Health Petitions Committee at an adjudication meeting. It is important that students submit a complete petition package with all relevant documentation for consideration by the Petitions Committee.</p>

<h3>Petition Deadlines</h3>

<p>A petition for late withdrawal must be submitted within 30 days of the last day of classes of the relevant course, up to one-year with grounds of extenuating circumstances to explain the lateness. Requests for deferred standing must be communicated within one week following a missed examination or the last day to submit course work. Normally, petitions will not be considered by the Faculty of Health Petitions Committee more than one year beyond the date of the release of grades for the session to which the petition relates.</p>

<h3>Delayed Petitions</h3>

<p>Should a petition submission be delayed due to extenuating circumstances, a student will be required to address the reason for the late submission. Waivers of submission deadlines will only be combined with adequate grounds supported by documentation of the extenuating circumstances that may have delayed the submission of a petition. Note: There are no guarantees that any petition will be resolved in time for course enrolment and/or convocation in a subsequent academic session, thus, one should plan accordingly.</p>

<h3>Initiating a Petition</h3>

<p>Information on initiating a petition, including an instructional video on the petitions process and all required documents may be found on the Faculty of Health petitions website:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.yorku.ca/health/petition-information-and-package/" target="_blank">yorku.ca/health/petition-information-and-package/</a>.</p>

<p>Faculty of Health students must submit their complete petition package online using the online submission system on the Faculty of Health petitions website.</p>

<p>Questions regarding academic petitions may be sent via email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hhpet@yorku.ca?subject=Initiating%20a%20Petition%20Inquiry">hhpet@yorku.ca</a>. Please allow 1-2 business days for a response.</p>

      <div>
              <div>
            <div><p>Students whose academic record does not meet Faculty or program standards are subject to the academic penalties of academic warning, required withdrawal, debarment warning, debarment and academic probation. Students enrolled in the bachelor of science in nursing degree program are subject to a separate set of academic penalties.</p>

<h3>Academic Warning</h3>

<p>Students whose cumulative grade point average falls below 4.00 at the end of any session, or who enter the Faculty with a grade point average equivalent to less than 4.00 on the York scale, receive an academic warning. Students on academic warning must achieve a cumulative grade point average of at least 4.00 within the next 24 credits taken, or earn a sessional grade point average of at least 5.00 in the session in which that 24th credit is completed and in each subsequent session until the cumulative grade point average reaches 4.00, or be required to withdraw. Students whose cumulative grade point average on at least 24 credits is below 2.50 will be required to withdraw.</p>

<h3>Required Withdrawal</h3>

<p>Students whose academic record shows marked weakness may be required to withdraw from their studies for one year, during which they are encouraged to identify and remedy any problems which may have contributed materially to their failure to perform up to their potential and to reflect on their reasons for pursuing a university education. The following regulations apply to required withdrawals.</p>

<p><strong>Grade point average below 2.50:</strong>&nbsp;Students whose cumulative grade point average on at least 24 York credits is below 2.50 must withdraw for 12 months.</p>

<p><strong>Grade point average below 4.00 and equal to or greater than 2.50:</strong>&nbsp;Students who have received an academic warning for a cumulative grade point average below 4.00 must achieve a cumulative grade point average of at least 4.00 within their next 24 credits taken or earn a sessional grade point average of at least 5.00 in the session in which that 24th credit is completed and in each subsequent session until the cumulative grade point average reaches 4.00; otherwise, they must withdraw for 12 months. Should the student’s cumulative grade point average fall below 2.50 at any time after completion of 24 York credits, they will be required to withdraw for 12 months.</p>

<p><strong>Petition to continue without interruption:</strong>&nbsp;Students who have been required to withdraw may submit a petition to the Faculty of Health Petitions Committee requesting permission to continue their studies without interruption. Students granted such a petition will be allowed to continue their studies on debarment warning.</p>

<p><strong>Reactivation after required withdrawal:</strong>&nbsp;Students who have been required to withdraw must apply for reactivation after the requisite period of absence by submitting a request online at the Reactivation Web page (<a href="https://registrar.yorku.ca/enrol/reactivate" title="http://www.registrar.yorku.ca/enrol/reactivate">registrar.yorku.ca/enrol/reactivate</a>). Students who return to their studies after such a required withdrawal (as well as those who have been allowed to continue their studies by virtue of a petition to the Faculty of Health Petitions Committee) receive a debarment warning.</p>

<h3>Debarment Warning</h3>

<p>Students who have been required to withdraw from the Faculty of Health or from another Faculty at York or elsewhere, receive a debarment warning upon continuing their studies in the Faculty. Students on debarment warning must achieve a cumulative grade point average of at least 4.00 within the next 24 credits taken or earn a sessional grade point average of at least 5.00 in the session in which that 24th credit is completed and in each subsequent session until the cumulative grade point average reaches 4.00, and must then maintain this average. Students who do not fulfill these conditions will be debarred from the University.</p>

<h3>Debarment</h3>

<p>Students who fail to meet the debarment warning conditions outlined above will be debarred from the University. Debarment, the minimum period for which is normally two years, means that the student is no longer a student at York University.</p>

<p><strong>Petition to continue without interruption:</strong>&nbsp;Students who have been debarred may submit a petition to the Faculty of Health Petitions Committee requesting permission to continue their studies without interruption. Students granted such a petition will be allowed to continue their studies on academic probation.</p>

<p><strong>Reapplying after debarment:</strong>&nbsp;Students who have been debarred and who wish to resume their studies must apply for admission through the Admissions Office (<a href="https://futurestudents.yorku.ca/" title="http://futurestudents.yorku.ca/">futurestudents.yorku.ca</a>)&nbsp;and must provide persuasive evidence that they are ready and able to complete a degree program. Students who are re-admitted (as well as those who have been allowed to continue their studies by virtue of a petition to the Faculty of Health Petitions Committee) receive an academic probation.</p>

<h3>Academic Probation</h3>

<p>Students who have been debarred and who subsequently resume their studies in the Faculty of Health, whether by petitioning to continue without interruption or by reapplying for admission, receive an academic probation. Students on academic probation must meet the debarment warning conditions outlined above; otherwise, they will be debarred again.</p>

<h3>Honours Bachelor Of Arts and Honours Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology and Health Science – Honours BA and BSC Kinesiology and Health Science</h3>

<p>Students must maintain the honours progression grade point average requirement to continue in the Kinesiology and Health Science program. Students who fail to meet the requirement will be exited from the program. Students with a cumulative grade point average of 4.00 or above may request to switch to an alternate 90-credit Bachelor program to continue their studies, subject to meeting the entry requirements of the program. Students with a cumulative grade point average below 4.00 will be ineligible to continue their studies at the University.</p>

<p><b>Petitions to improve cumulative grade point average:</b> If there are grounds, a student may submit a petition to the Faculty of Health Petitions Committee requesting to withdraw late from previous courses to improve their grade point average. Students who are granted such petitions may improve their grade point average may be eligible to switch to a Bachelor program.</p>

<h3>Honours Bachelor of Science in Nursing - Honours BScN (All Streams)</h3>

<h4><b>Program Warning for Honours BScN</b></h4>

<p>BScN students who have completed less than 120 credits will be placed on a program warning if the cumulative grade point average is at least 4.00 but is below 5.00.</p>

<p>Students may continue in BScN providing they meet the program warning conditions outlined below.</p>

<p><strong>Program warning conditions for BScN:</strong>&nbsp;BScN students on program warning, within the next 24 credits taken, must have a cumulative grade point average of at least 5.00. At no time may the cumulative grade point average fall below 4.00. At no time may the cumulative grade point average fall below 2.50 upon completion of at least 24 York credits.</p>

            <div><p>The Faculty of Health considers academic advising an important responsibility. The term academic advising covers a number of complementary functions related to assisting students, such as:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>understanding degree and program requirements;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>understanding degree classifications&nbsp;(90-credit BA, BSc, BHS; 120-credit Honours BA, Honours BSc, Honours BHS; 120-credit Specialized Honours BA, Specialized Honours BSc, Specialized Honours BHS, Specialized Honours BScN);</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>understanding Faculty legislation and policies;</li>
	<li>understanding your grade report and academic standing.</li>
</ul>

<p>These functions may vary in their significance to students at different times of the academic year and at different points in students’ academic careers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Advising students is a shared responsibility between Faculty of Health schools and departments and the Office of Student and Academic Services. Students contact these offices throughout the year for advice and information related to their academic career including academic performance, degree&nbsp;programs and requirements.&nbsp;</p>
