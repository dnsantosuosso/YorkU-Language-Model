<p>Students who are participating in the Consecutive program model have already been accepted to the BEd program with the understanding that they have met the requirements for their teaching subjects.</p>

<p>Since students in the Concurrent program model are completing two degrees concurrently, they need to ensure that they are meeting pre-requisites for the BEd courses in their other degree. The following information outlines these requirements.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Concurrent Degree Requirements</h4>

<p>Students who are enrolled concurrently in two degrees at York University must ensure that they have met the requirements in their Bachelor's degree in order to fulfill the requirements for teaching subjects in the Bachelor of Education.&nbsp;</p>

<h5>Primary-Junior Requirements - Concurrent</h5>

<p>Since the Primary-Junior teacher must be a generalist, it is strongly recommended that students in the Primary-Junior program take, as part of their co-registered program, some of the following courses in their York degree program:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Six credits in Science&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Six credits in Fine Arts&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Six credits in History or Geography&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Six credits in English or Humanities&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Six credits in Mathematics&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Six credits in Kinesiology and Health Science&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h4>Junior-Intermediate Requirements - Concurrent&nbsp;</h4>

<p>The Junior-Intermediate program qualifies students to teach in Grades 4 to 10. By current Ontario College of Teachers’ regulations, all students must prepare to teach one subject at the Intermediate level as well as to teach all subjects at the generalist level in the Junior-Intermediate division.</p>

<p>Students may choose their Intermediate division subject from the list of subjects listed above. Students may complete a three-year or four-year (Honours) degree program with a minimum C+ overall average or a 5.00 grade point average.</p>

<p>When selecting their teaching subject, students should note the academic requirements for each subject and the prerequisites for curriculum and instruction courses. For the Junior-Intermediate program, a minimum of 24 credits (four full university courses or equivalent) in a subject must be taken in order to register in the teaching subject curriculum ED/XXXX 3000 3.00 and instruction course. Students are required to have a minimum of 24 credits (four full university courses or equivalent) in the teaching subject to graduate.</p>

<h4>Intermediate-Senior Requirements - Concurrent&nbsp;</h4>

<p>The Intermediate-Senior program qualifies students to teach in Grades 7 to 12. The degree may be taken only in conjunction with a four-year (Honours) degree program with a minimum C+ overall average or a 5.00 grade point average. By Ontario College of Teachers’ regulations, all students in the Intermediate-Senior program must become qualified to teach two subjects at the Intermediate-Senior level.</p>

<p>It is recommended that students declare their teaching subjects as a Major or Minor in their undergraduate degree program. Students may choose their Intermediate-Senior division subjects from the list above. When selecting two teaching subjects, students should note the academic requirements for each subject and the prerequisites for curriculum and instruction courses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the Intermediate-Senior program, students require a minimum of 36 credits (six full university courses) in one teaching subject area and 18 credits (three full university courses) in the other area to graduate.&nbsp;</p>

<h5>Teaching Subject Details - Concurrent&nbsp;</h5>

<p>The requirements noted below are for admission to the Intermediate-Senior teaching subject courses (ED/XXXX 4000 3.00 and ED/XXXX 4001 3.00) and for the Junior-Intermediate teaching subject course (ED/XXXX 3000 3.00); these courses are separate from the requirements for the home Faculty degree.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Junior-Intermediate:</strong> 24 credits (four full university courses or equivalent) in a subject must be completed in order to register in the teaching subject curriculum and instruction course.

Failure to do so may result in a suspension or involuntary withdrawal from the program or other appropriate recommendation at the discretion of the Faculty Advisor and the Associate Dean (Academic Programs).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Students may wish to consult with teachers' unions (e.g., Qualifications Evaluation Council of Ontario (QECO); Ontario Secondary School Teachers Federation (OSSTF)) regarding salary schedules, which may relate to teachers' undergraduate degree programs.</p>

            <div><p>The BA Educational Studies program provides students with the foundational knowledge and skills to understand and analyze education and its role in contemporary society, and to develop students' skills to enable them to undertake educational work in <em>non-teacher-certification</em> contexts. The program builds on the Faculty of Education's strength in the study of education as a field. It resonates with the university's interests in collaborating with communities, experiential education, and social engagement in that the study of education is intensely concerned with the contexts in which learning occurs and the experiential component actively involves students in the work of education. This unique blend positions York University as a North American leader in the study of education.</p>

<p>Students in the program will have opportunities to develop knowledge of the ways in which education operates officially and unofficially in contemporary culture, the values that underpin different conceptions of education, and the strategies that can be used in the service of educational work. Our goal is to create individuals who not only understand the intrinsic qualities of education, but, also, understand that, even though education is a contested domain, it offers considerable instrumental potential towards life-changing trajectories for individuals, whether those potentials are realized in formal or informal educational contexts.</p>

            <div><p>The York University Faculty of Education <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/edu/students/deaf-and-hard-of-hearing/">Deaf and Hard of Hearing Teacher Education</a> program prepares qualified teachers to work in a variety of educational settings and communication/modality options. The program provides the broadest possible base for candidates to learn about the field, and to make decisions about areas of specialization.</p>

<p>Program coursework deals with areas pertinent to deaf and hard of hearing education. These areas include: language and literacy development; oral communication; deaf and hard of hearing studies; bilingual/bicultural education; American Sign Language; audiology; listening and speaking; working with deaf and hard of hearing learners in inclusive settings and amplification systems. Candidates also participate in two practicum placements in two different settings over a two-month period.</p>

<p>The program is regulated by the Ontario College of Teachers (OCT) and requires students to complete compulsory components:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.yorku.ca/edu/students/deaf-and-hard-of-hearing/">Coursework</a></li>
	<li>Experiential Placements - Practica
	<ul>
		<li>All students must complete 400 hours of practicum (320 hours of direct teaching and 80 hours of observation).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>For <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/edu/students/deaf-and-hard-of-hearing/how-to-apply/">admissions information</a>, visit the Faculty of Education's website.</p>

<h4>Diploma and Recommendations</h4>

<p>Upon successful completion of the program, students will receive a York University Post-Baccalaureate Diploma. Ontario-certified teachers are then also recommended for certification as Teachers of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, Oral/Aural Communication or ASL to the <a href="https://www.oct.ca/">Ontario College of Teachers (OCT)</a>.</p>

<p>The program is accredited by the Ontario College of Teachers (OCT) and by the Canadian Association of Educators of the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (CAEDHH).</p>

<p>Currently, for eligible Ontario candidates, no tuition fees are charged for the program, but course and materials fees will be required for various courses. A limited number of out-of-province spaces are available; these candidates are charged tuition as well as the course and material fees.</p>

<h4>Full-time Program</h4>

<p>The full-time program is offered in one academic year, over two semesters beginning in August and finishing in May. Students enrolled in the full-time program primarily access courses by attending face-to-face classes on the York University campus, with some online learning activities. Full-time students are expected to complete the entire program as a cohort in one year.</p>

<h4>Part-time Program</h4>

<p>The part-time program is a three-year program beginning in August and finishing in May of each year. Part-time students complete the majority of their courses online, but are required to attend classes on campus for some specific courses. Part-time students enrol in two courses per term in a prescribed order. Students enrolled in the part-time program should plan to dedicate approximately five to seven hours <em>per course</em> each week. This time commitment takes into account participation in the online class (i.e., viewing the sessions) and completing the associated coursework.</p>

<h4>Grade Requirements</h4>

<p>To remain registered in the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Teacher Education Program, students must maintain a minimum grade of a C+ in each course. If a failing grade is received in any course or experiential practicum placement, students will be ineligible to continue and will be withdrawn from the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Teacher Education Program. In addition, Ontario participants must maintain current, unrestricted membership in good standing with the Ontario College of Teachers (OCT) through the entire program.</p>

<h4>Plagiarism</h4>

<p>Plagiarism is defined as the presentation of work as one’s own which originates from some other, unacknowledged source. In examinations, term papers and other graded assignments, verbatim or almost verbatim presentation of someone else’s work without attribution constitutes plagiarism. This is deemed to include the presentation, without acknowledgement, of someone else’s argument in the student’s own work as if it were one’s own.</p>

<h4>Cheating</h4>

<p>Cheating is defined as the giving or receiving or utilizing, or attempt at giving or receiving or utilizing, unauthorized information or assistance during or before an examination; or the presentation of a single work to more than one course without the permission of the instructors involved.</p>

<p>In all cases of suspected breaches of academic honesty, the Course Director must consult with the student. Minor or major penalties may be applied should the instructor believe that grounds exist for official action. The student has the right to appeal any allegation of plagiarism or cheating.</p>

<p>If students are uncertain whether a course of action might constitute cheating or plagiarism, they should consult the instructor concerned in advance.</p>

<p>BA Educational Studies students may withdraw from courses without receiving a grade if they do so by the published withdrawal dates. Students who withdraw from an Education practicum seminar, or from any course in the Bachelor of Education (BEd) program, however, should note that they will be required to petition for reinstatement to the Faculty of Education (BEd) if they wish to resume the teaching certification. To withdraw from an Education course, students must report their intent to the Faculty of Education's Student Services Office, in accordance with the published withdrawal dates. Those who withdraw from a course after these dates are normally deemed to have failed it and receive a grade of F.</p>

<h4>Program Withdrawals</h4>

<p>Students who withdraw from the Faculty of Education, and who are registered in the BEd Concurrent model&nbsp;<em>or</em>&nbsp;Bachelor of Arts (Educational Studies) program, may transfer their accumulated education credits to their academic Faculty subject to the rules and procedures of that Faculty. Any grades transferred in this manner are then subject to the regulations governing maintenance of standing in the other Faculty. Students must report their intention to withdraw both to the Faculty of Education's Student Services office and to their home Faculty.</p>

<h4>Faculty Legislation on Involuntary Withdrawal</h4>

<p>A student may be required to withdraw from a course if:</p>

<ol start="1">
	<li>The student fails to meet the requirements of a course, either through unsatisfactory seminar and/or practicum attendance/participation, or through unprofessional behaviour in fulfilling course requirements; or</li>
	<li>The student’s performance is judged to disrupt seriously the functioning of the host classroom and/or the well-being of the students in that classroom.</li>
</ol>

<p>The decision to require the student to withdraw will be taken by the Associate Dean (Undergraduate Academic Programs) on the recommendation of the Course Director following a meeting with the student. Students will have access to the usual appeal procedures in such instances.</p>
