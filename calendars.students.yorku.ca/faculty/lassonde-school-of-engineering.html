            <div><h4>The Credit System</h4>

<p>The Lassonde School of Engineering operates under a credit system in which a prescribed number of credits, intended to reflect total workload, is associated with each course offered by the University. One academic credit is defined as one lecture/laboratory hour per week per term. At York University course (with the exception of some courses offered by the Faculty of Education), the number of credits in each course is indicated by the number which follows the four-digit course number.</p>

<h4>Year of Study Equivalents</h4>

<p>When it is necessary to equate credits earned with year level, the following guidelines are used for all Lassonde degrees (except BEng):</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Year Level</th>
			<th>Credit Range</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Year 1</td>
			<td>0 to 23</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Year 2</td>
			<td>24 to 53</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Year 3</td>
			<td>54 to 83</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Year 4</td>
			<td>84+</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>For BEng, the following guidelines are used:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Year Level</th>
			<th>Credit Range</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Year 1</td>
			<td>0 to 35</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Year 2</td>
			<td>36 to 71</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Year 3</td>
			<td>72 to 107</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Year 4</td>
			<td>108+</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h4>Residence Requirement</h4>

<p>In order to qualify for a York University degree in any bachelor or Honours program, a student must have successfully completed a minimum of 30 credits at York University and at least half (50 per cent) of the requirements in each major/minor.</p>

<h4>Time Limit</h4>

<p>There is no time limit for completion of degree requirements in the Lassonde School of Engineering. Students taking a course load of approximately 30-39 credits per fall/winter session can expect to complete a bachelor's degree in three fall/winter sessions or an Honours degree in four fall/winter sessions. A limited number of courses are also available during the summer session.</p>

<p>Although there is no minimum number of credits in which a student must enrol in any session, students who do not enrol in any courses in a fall/winter session must formally apply to have their student record <a href="https://registrar.yorku.ca/enrol/reactivate">reactivated</a> before resuming their studies in a subsequent session (refer to Reactivation in the Lassonde School of Engineering Advising, Enrolment, Registration, Graduation and Other Administrative Procedures section).</p>

<p>Since the curriculum is constantly evolving through the introduction of new course requirements and/or prerequisites, students are strongly advised to complete their degree requirements in a reasonable time period.</p>

<h4>Course Credit Exclusions</h4>

<p>The University offers some courses in which at least part of the content is similar to that presented in other courses. To ensure that credit is not granted more than once for similar content, the Lassonde School of Engineering designates such courses as course credit exclusions. The exclusion(s) for a particular course are listed in the course description.</p>

<p>If a student in the Lassonde School of Engineering enrols in and successfully completes two courses which are designated as exclusions of each other, credit is given for only one. Both courses appear on the student's official York University transcript.</p>

<p>A course (or combination of courses) designated as an exclusion for another course may be substituted for the latter (for the purposes of satisfying prerequisite and/or degree requirements) only with Faculty/department/division/program approval. Information regarding approved substitute courses may be found in the program of study requirements in the Lassonde School of Engineering Programs of Study section, in the prerequisite requirements listed for courses in this publication or in the departmental supplementary calendars. Please contact <a href="https://lassonde.yorku.ca/meet-advisor">Academic Advising</a> for more information.</p>

<h4>Non-Science Requirement</h4>

<p>The non-science requirement provides a broad perspective on current scholarship and the diversity of human experience. These courses are also expected to enhance students' critical skills in reading, writing and thinking, and contribute to their preparation for post-university life.</p>

<h4>BEng Requirements</h4>

<h5>Complementary Studies Requirement</h5>

<p>A total of 12 credits of complementary studies courses must be taken by Engineering majors as follows:</p>

<p><u>3 credits must be taken in the humanities or social sciences, defined by the following subject areas:</u></p>

<p>Anthropology; Canadian Studies; Children; Childhood &amp; Youth Studies; Communications; Culture; English; Gender &amp; Women’s Studies; History; Human Rights and Equity Studies; Humanities; Indigenous Studies; Languages (e.g. American Sign Language, Arabic, Catalan, Chinese, Classical Greek, English as a Second Language, French as a Second Language, French, German, Hebrew, Hindi, Italian, Jamaican-Creole, Japanese, Korean, Latin, Modern Greek, Persian, Portuguese, Spanish, Swahili); Linguistics; Modes of Reasoning; Multicultural and Indigenous Studies; Philosophy; Politicial Science; Religious Studies; Social Science; Sociology; and Writing.</p>

<p>Refer to <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/secretariat/policies/policies/grading-scheme-and-feedback-policy/">Grading Scheme &amp; Feedback Policy</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/secretariat/policies/policies/common-grading-scheme-for-undergraduate-faculties/">Common Grading Scheme for Undergraduate Faculties</a> within the Senate Policies.</p>

<h3>Pass/Fail Grading Option</h3>

<p>A pass/fail grading option is available to Lassonde School of Engineering students within the guidelines as outlined in <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/secretariat/policies/policies/pass-fail-grades-policy/" title="Senate Policy">Senate Policy</a> and explained on the <a href="https://myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/pass-fail-option" title="Pass/Fail">Pass/Fail</a> website .</p>

<h3>Repeated Courses</h3>

<p>Students may repeat a passed or failed course twice for academic degree or certificate credit, for a maximum of three (3) attempts at a course or the course credit exclusion of the course. Students should note that course availability and space considerations may preclude the possibility of repeating a course in the session they choose.</p>

<p>Credit towards your degree will only be counted once for repeated courses taken at York or elsewhere. All repeated passed or failed attempts are subject to the University's <a href="https://calendars.students.yorku.ca/2022-2023/policy-on-repeating-passed-or-failed-courses-for-academic-credit">Policy on Repeating Passed or Failed Courses For Academic Credit</a>.</p>

<p>A student must be eligible to proceed in a degree or certificate program in order to be eligible to repeat a course.</p>

<h3>Academic Standards for Bachelor and Honours Programs</h3>

<h4>Bachelor Programs</h4>

<p>To graduate in a bachelor program requires successful completion of all Faculty, departmental and program requirements, and a minimum cumulative credit-weighted grade point average of 4.00 (C) over all courses earned.</p>

<h4>Limited Additional Credits</h4>

<p>Students in a bachelor program who have passed 90 credits in accordance with Faculty and program requirements, but whose cumulative overall grade point average is below 4.00 (C), may attempt to raise their average by taking up to 12 additional credits, to a maximum of 102 credits. These courses must be above the 1000 level and must be taken at York University. Regulations on equivalent and excluded courses apply.</p>

<h4>Honours Bachelor Programs (BSc, iBSc, BA, iBA)</h4>

<p>To progress in the Honours program, upon completion of each academic session, students must have a cumulative average as follows:</p>

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>EARNED Credit Range</th>
			<th>Cumulative GRADE POINT Average Required</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>0 to 23</td>
			<td>4.00</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>24 to 53</td>
			<td>4.25</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>54 to 83</td>
			<td>4.80</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>84 or higher</td>
			<td>5.00</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Students who have earned 84 credits and who wish to proceed in an Honours program must have an overall cumulative grade point average (OCGPA) of 5.00. If a student does not achieve a 5.00 OCGPA upon completion of their 84th credit, they must petition to waive Honours standing for consideration to be in and/or return to an Honours program.</p>

<p>To graduate in an Honours program requires successful completion of all Faculty, departmental and program requirements, and a minimum cumulative credit-weighted grade point average of 5.00 (C+) over all courses earned.</p>

<h4>Honours Bachelor of Engineering Programs (BEng)</h4>

<p>To progress in the Honours program, upon completion of each academic session, students must have a cumulative average in credits taken as follows:</p>

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>TAKEN Credit Range</th>
			<th>Cumulative GRADE POINT Average Required</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>0 to 35</td>
			<td>4.00</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>36 to 71</td>
			<td>4.25</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>72 to 107</td>
			<td>4.80</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>108 or higher</td>
			<td>5.00</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Students who have taken 108 credits, and who wish to proceed in an Honours program must have a cumulative grade point average of 5.00 overall. If a student does not achieve a 5.00 OCGPA on the completion of their 108th credit (or higher), they must <a href="https://lassonde.yorku.ca/student-life/petitions">petition to waive Honours standing</a> for consideration to be in and/or return to an Honours program.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the 108th credit where honours progression is not met, they must submit an <a href="https://lassonde.yorku.ca/student-life/honours-waivers">Honours waiver</a> for consideration to be in and/or return to an Honours program.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To graduate in an Honours BEng program requires successful completion of all Faculty, departmental and program requirements, and a minimum cumulative credit-weighted grade point average of 5.00 (C+) over all courses taken.</p>

<h3>Academic Standing Requirements for Visiting Students</h3>

<p>Individuals who wish to enrol in undergraduate credit courses, but who do not intend to complete a degree or a certificate may be admitted to York as a visiting student. To learn more, refer to the <a href="https://futurestudents.yorku.ca/requirements/visiting" title="Admission and Application Procedures for Visiting Students">Admission and Application Procedures for Visiting Students</a>.</p>

<h3>Designation of Honours or Bachelor Program</h3>

<p><strong>Automatic Honours designation.</strong> Students are automatically considered to be in an Honours program provided they achieve and maintain the minimum grade requirements for Honours described under the Academic Standards for Bachelor and Honours Programs section above.</p>

<p><strong>Automatic Bachelor designation.</strong> Depending on the program, students are automatically considered to be in a Bachelor program if they fail to achieve or maintain the minimum grade requirements for Honours described under the Academic Standards for Bachelor and Honours Programs section above. Students who have been exited from their Honours program, e.g. Bachelor of Engineering students who don’t meet honours progression requirements, will be notified via email prior to being switched to an alternate Bachelor program.</p>

<p><strong>Option to graduate with a Bachelor program.</strong> Students registered for an Honours degree may opt to graduate with a Bachelor degree if they fulfill Bachelor program requirements. Refer to Graduation in the Lassonde School of Engineering Advising, Enrolment, Registration, Graduation and Other Administrative Procedures section for details.</p>

<h3>Term Work</h3>

<p>All final grades, including those assigned after deferred examinations, are calculated in a way which assigns a specific weighting to the term work done in addition to the final (or deferred) examination. The weighting is set by the course director and must be announced and available in writing within the first two weeks of classes. If possible, information about assignments and grades for all courses should be made known to students at or before the first class/meeting. A previously announced marking scheme for a course may be changed by the course director with the consent of students enrolled in the course; the new marking scheme must also be distributed in written form.</p>

<p>Prior to the final date to withdraw from a course without receiving a grade, graded feedback worth at least 15 per cent of the final grade for fall, winter or summer term and 30 per cent for ‘full year’ courses offered in the fall/winter session is received by students in all courses (except undergraduate courses where course work consists of a single piece of work, practicum courses, ungraded courses, courses in Faculties where the drop date occurs within the first three weeks of classes, courses which run on a compressed schedule). Students who, in the absence of recognized extenuating circumstances, fail to complete such course work cannot use the lack of feedback as grounds for withdrawal. Please see the <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/secretariat/policies/policies/grading-scheme-and-feedback-policy/">Senate Policy on Grading Scheme and Feedback</a> for additional information.</p>

<p>No examinations or tests collectively worth more than 20 per cent of the final grade in a course will be given during the final 14 calendar days of classes in a term. The exceptions to the rule are classes which regularly meet Friday evenings or on Saturday and/or Sunday at any time, and courses offered in the compressed summer terms. Please see the <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/secretariat/policies/policies/limits-on-the-worth-of-examinations-in-the-final-classes-of-a-term-policy/">Senate Policy on Limits on the Worth of Examinations in the Final Classes of a Term</a> for additional information.</p>

<p>All tests in a given section of a course must be given during the class or tutorial times listed in the lecture schedule for that section of the course. The only exception is the scheduling of common tests administered to multiple-section courses; in such cases students with a conflict must be given reasonable accommodation.</p>

<p>Term work in any course may not be submitted later than the first day of the final examination period for the course. Earlier final dates for the submission of term work may be set at the discretion of the department/division concerned.</p>

<p>The student is responsible for ensuring that all written term work is received by the instructor concerned.</p>

<h3>Examinations</h3>

<p>Refer to the following policies, procedures, and guidelines governing the conduct of examinations:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.yorku.ca/secretariat/policies/policies/conduct-of-examinations-policy-guidelines/" title="Senate Policy and Guidelines Governing the Conduct of Examinations">Senate Policy and Guidelines Governing the Conduct of Examinations</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.yorku.ca/secretariat/policies/policies/academic-honesty-senate-policy-on/" title="Senate Policy on Academic Honesty">Senate Policy on Academic Honesty</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Individual instructors and/or invigilators may also provide specific instruction on the conduct of examinations for courses.</p>

<p>Final examination answer sheets/booklets become the property of the teaching unit. Students have the right to review their graded tests and examinations once the grades have been published by the Registrar’s Office. Students may request a copy at cost from the teaching unit.</p>

<h3>Aegrotat Standing</h3>

<p>Aegrotat standing may apply where a student cannot be expected to complete coursework for medical or compassionate reasons. A petition for aegrotat standing may be submitted. It is the responsibility of the student to ensure that full documentation (medical or other) is provided in support of requests for aegrotat standing. If granted, the phrase AEG "aegrotat standing" is substituted for the grade on the transcript.</p>

<p>Aegrotat standing is seldom granted where only the final exam has not been written; instead, the student may be granted permission to write a deferred exam.</p>

<p>For more information, refer to the <a href="https://myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/deferred-standing" title="Deferred Standing">Deferred Standing</a> website and the <a href="https://lassonde.yorku.ca/student-life/petitions" title="Lassonde Academic Petitions">Lassonde Academic Petitions</a> website.</p>

<h3>Deferred Standing</h3>

<p>If a student is unable to write a final exam or submit a final culminating assignment, they may wish to pursue deferred standing. Deferred standing may be granted or denied. For more information, refer to the <a href="http://myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/deferred-standing" title="Deferred Standing">Deferred Standing</a> website and the <a href="https://lassonde.yorku.ca/student-life/petitions" title="Lassonde Academic Petitions">Lassonde Academic Petitions</a> website.</p>

<h3>Reappraisal of Final Grades</h3>

<p>Students may, with sufficient academic grounds, request that a final grade in a course be reappraised. Students are normally expected to first contact the course director to discuss the grade received and to request that their tangible work be reviewed. For further information, refer to the <a href="https://myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/grade-reappraisal-policy" title="Grade Reappraisal Policy">Grade Reappraisal Principles</a>.</p>

<h3>Recognition of Excellence</h3>

<h4>Dean's Honour Roll</h4>

<p>The annual Dean's Honour Roll recognizes academic excellence by assigning the notation "Member of Dean’s Honour Roll" to the grade report and transcript of a student who achieves a sessional credit-weighted grade point average of 7.50 or higher on a minimum of 24 credits, or, in the final year of study, a minimum of 18 credits.</p>

<p>Students co-registered in the Faculty of Education, who are registered in a minimum of 24 credits overall (of which at least 18 credits are for the bachelor or Honours degree in the Lassonde School of Engineering) and who achieve a sessional credit-weighted grade point average of 7.50 or higher on their credits for the bachelor or Honours in the Lassonde School of Engineering, are also eligible to be on the Lassonde School of Engineering Dean’s Honour Roll.</p>

<h4>First-Class Degrees</h4>

<p>The Lassonde School of Engineering rewards exceptional students by designating their degrees "first class" or "first class with distinction".</p>

<p>First-class standing is normally awarded to students whose cumulative overall credit-weighted grade point average is 7.50 or higher.</p>

<p>With distinction is normally added to the first-class degree of students whose cumulative overall credit-weighted grade point average is 8.00 (A) or higher.</p>

<h3>Warnings and Sanctions</h3>

<p>Students whose academic record does not meet the degree standards are subject to the academic penalties of<em> academic warning</em>, <em>required withdrawal</em>, <em>debarment warning</em>, <em>debarment</em> and <em>academic probation</em>, as set out below. In sum, students on <em>Academic Warning</em> who do not meet the GPA requirements, in the first instance will be <em>Required to Withdraw</em> from the University for 12 months. Students who return to the University after a required withdrawal, via the reactivation process, or via an approved academic petition, are placed on <em>Debarment Warning</em>. Failure to meet the GPA requirements while on debarment warning will result in students being <em>Debarred</em> for 24 months. Students who wish to return to the University after a debarment decision may petition to continue their studies or must apply to be re-admitted after the 24-month debarment period. Students who return to the University after debarment, via the re-application process, or via an approved academic petition, are placed on <em>Academic Probation</em>.</p>

<h4>Academic Warning</h4>

<p>Students whose cumulative overall grade point average falls below 4.00 (C), but is equal to or greater than 2.50, at the end of any session receive an academic warning. Students who enter the Faculty with a grade point average equivalent to less than 4.00 (C) receive an academic warning.</p>

<h4>Academic Warning Conditions</h4>

<p>Students on academic warning must achieve a cumulative grade point average of at least 4.00 within the next 24 credits taken, or earn a sessional grade point average of at least 5.00 in the session in which that 24th credit is taken and in each subsequent session until the cumulative grade point average reaches 4.00, or be required to withdraw. Students whose cumulative grade point average is below 2.50 after at least 24 York credits have been taken will be required to withdraw for 12 months.</p>

<h4>Required Withdrawal</h4>

<p>Students whose academic record shows marked weakness will be required to withdraw from their studies for 12 months, during which they are encouraged to identify and remedy any problems which may have contributed materially to their failure to perform up to their potential, and to reflect on their reasons for pursuing a university education. The following regulations apply to required withdrawal:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Grade point average below 2.50:</strong> Students whose cumulative grade point average is below 2.50 after at least 24 York credits have been taken will be required to withdraw for 12 months.</li>
	<li><strong>Failure to satisfy Academic Warning conditions:</strong> students who have received an academic warning for a cumulative grade point average below 4.00, but equal to or greater than 2.50, must satisfy the academic warning conditions as specified above or be required to withdraw for 12 months.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Petition to Continue without Interruption</h4>

<p>Students who have been required to withdraw may submit a <a href="https://lassonde.yorku.ca/student-life/petitions">petition</a> to the Lassonde Academic Petitions and Appeals Committee requesting permission to continue their studies on Debarment Warning.</p>

<h4>Reactivation after Required Withdrawal</h4>

<p>Students who have been required to withdraw may apply for reactivation after the requisite period of absence by submitting a request via the <a href="https://registrar.yorku.ca/enrol/reactivate">Reactivation</a> website. Students who return to their studies after such a Required Withdrawal receive a Debarment Warning.</p>

<h4>Debarment Warning</h4>

<p>Students who have been required to withdraw in the Lassonde School of Engineering, or the equivalent in another Faculty at York University or elsewhere, receive a Debarment Warning upon continuing their studies in the University.</p>

<h4>Debarment Warning Conditions</h4>

<p>Students on Debarment Warning must achieve a cumulative grade point average of at least 4.00 within the next 24 credits taken or earn a sessional grade point average of at least 5.00 in the session in which the 24th credit is completed and in each subsequent session until the cumulative average reaches 4.00, and must then maintain this average in order to continue.</p>

<h4>Debarment</h4>

<p>Students whose academic record continues to show marked weakness will be debarred from their studies for 24 months, during which they are encouraged to continue to identify and remedy any problems which may have contributed materially to their failure to perform up to their potential.</p>

<h4>Petition to Continue without Interruption</h4>

<p>Students who have been debarred may submit a petition to the Lassonde Academic Petitions and Appeals Committee requesting permission to continue their studies on academic probation.</p>

<h4>Reapplying after Debarment</h4>

<p>Students who have been debarred and who wish to resume their studies must apply for re-admission through the Admissions Office, and must provide persuasive evidence that they are ready and able to complete a degree program. Students who are re-admitted continue on <em>Academic Probation</em>.</p>

<h4>Academic Probation</h4>

<p>Students who have been debarred and who subsequently resume their studies in the University, whether by petitioning to continue without interruption or by applying for readmission, receive an Academic Probation. Students on Academic Probation must meet the Debarment Warning Conditions outlined above; otherwise, they will be debarred again.</p>

<h3>Appeals Procedures</h3>

<p>Appeals by students and/or faculty members against rulings of the Academic Petitions and Appeals Committee must be filed in writing submitted online via the <a href="https://lassonde.yorku.ca/student-life/appeals">Lassonde Academic Appeals</a> website, within 15 calendar days of the date of official notification of the decision.</p>

<p>Appeals against rulings of the Academic Petitions and Appeals Committee will be heard by an independent panel comprised of at least two eligible faculty members and one eligible student representative.</p>

<p>Members shall disqualify themselves if they are involved as a party or witness in the case or believe that they could not be impartial. Where members disqualify themselves, alternate members will replace them.</p>

<p>Appeals are heard only on the following grounds:</p>

<ol start="1">
	<li>new evidence; i.e., evidence that, through no fault of the appellant, could not reasonably have been presented at an earlier level (as a guide, events or performance subsequent to the decisions of the Academic Petitions and Appeals Committee are not to be construed as new evidence);</li>
	<li>evidence of procedural irregularity in the previous consideration of the case by the Academic Petitions and Appeals Committee. This may be understood to include actions taken by the Lassonde School of Engineering, its officers, committees or members with respect to the case which would violate or nullify any of the following:
	<ul>
		<li>normal and written procedures of the Faculty;</li>
		<li>recognized custom of the Faculty;</li>
		<li>the principles of natural justice and fairness.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>If the route of appeal has been exhausted at the Faculty-level, further appeals may be made to the <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/secretariat/senate/appeals-committee/appealing-to-the-senate-appeals-committee/">Senate Appeals Committee</a>.</p>

<p>Appeals against rulings of the Committee on Examinations and Academic Standards (e.g., academic honesty rulings) must be filed directly to the Senate Appeals Committee. There is no Faculty-level appeals process with respect to academic honesty rulings. Enquiries about appeals of this sort, and the grounds upon which they may be filed, should be directed to the University Secretariat <a href="mailto:appeals@yorku.ca">appeals@yorku.ca</a> or 1050 Kaneff Tower, 4700 Keele St., Toronto, ON, M3J1P3.</p>

Academic advisors also provide instruction as part of the new student enrolment appointment experience. Students are strongly recommended to seek individual support regarding course selection and enrolment from academic advisors at the Lassonde Student Welcome and Support Centre.</p>

<p>During the enrolment process, the regulations below should be followed:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Prerequisites/Corequisites:</strong> Most courses have prerequisite and/or corequisite requirements. These may be specific courses (indicating specific required background knowledge) or they may be general prerequisites (e.g., a minimum required GPA or specific course grade prior to enrolling in higher-level courses). It is the student's responsibility to enrol in only those courses for which the student has successfully completed all designated prerequisites and to take concurrently all specified corequisites not already completed successfully, regardless of whether the course is a degree requirement. A prerequisite course(s) is deemed to be completed when the student receives a passing grade in each listed prerequisite course. Students who lack the stated prerequisites but have reason to believe that they can succeed in a course must obtain written permission of the department concerned (consult the <a href="https://registrar.yorku.ca/enrol/course-contacts">department office</a> regarding the procedure to be followed) before enrolling.</li>
	<li><strong>Add, Drop, and Withdrawal Deadlines:</strong> Students are obligated to enrol, de-enrol, or withdraw from courses within the <a href="https://registrar.yorku.ca/enrol/dates">published deadlines</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Conflict-free Timetable:</strong> Students should not be enrolling in courses, labs, and/or tutorials that are in conflict.</li>
	<li><strong>Course Credit Exclusions:</strong> Students are strongly urged to consult an advisor before enrolling in any two courses which are designated as course credit exclusions. For more information regarding course credit exclusions, refer to Course Credit Exclusions in the Lassonde School of Engineering Regulations Governing Undergraduate Degree Requirements section.</li>
	<li><strong>Credit Load:</strong> A maximum of 33 credits in total may be taken by BA, iBA, BSc, iBSc, BASc students, or 39 credits for BEng students during a fall/winter session. A maximum of 15 credits in total may be taken by BA, iBA, BSc, iBSc, BASc students, or 18 credits for BEng students during a summer session at York University.</li>
	<li><strong>BEng Sections:</strong> Students registered in the Bachelor of Engineering program are required to enrol in LE/EECS courses that are categorized as Section E, Section F, Section G Section X, Section Y or Section Z only.
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Exceptions:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://w2prod.sis.yorku.ca/Apps/WebObjects/cdm.woa/wa/crsq?fa=LE&amp;sj=EECS&amp;cn=1028&amp;cr=3.00&amp;ay=2022&amp;ss=FW">LE/EECS 1028 3.00</a> may be completed in any section.</li>
			<li>Upper year technical electives for Computer, Software, and Electrical Engineering students may be completed in any section. If an E/F/G/X/Y/Z section is offered, students are recommended to complete the E/F/G/X/Y/Z section.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Instructional Formats:</strong> York University courses are offered in a variety of formats depending on the program, department, and Faculty, and in consideration of University policies and procedures. Course formats are available for students on the <a href="https://w2prod.sis.yorku.ca/Apps/WebObjects/cdm">York Courses</a> website.</li>
	<li><strong>Full-time or Part-time Status:</strong> Full-time or part-time status for undergraduate students is determined by the number of credits within which a student is enrolled per term. For assistance <a href="https://osap.yorku.ca/calculating-course-load">calculating course load for OSAP purposes</a>, students may refer to <a href="https://osap.yorku.ca/contact-osap">Registrarial Services</a>. In a fall/winter session:
	<ul>
		<li>Full-time status is defined as: Enrolled in minimum 9.00 credits per term (6.00 credits per term if registered with Student Accessibility Services)</li>
		<li>Part-time status is defined as: Enrolled in less than 9.00 credits per term (less than 6.00 credits per term if registered with Student Accessibility Services)</li>
