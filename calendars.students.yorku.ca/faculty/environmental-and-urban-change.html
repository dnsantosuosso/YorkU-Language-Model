            <div><h4>General Education</h4>

<p>The Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change is committed to ensuring that all students are exposed to the Humanities, the Social Sciences and the Natural Sciences through ensuring a robust General Education requirement. The general education requirement provides a broad perspective on current scholarship and the diversity of human experience. We strive to provide a broader general education curriculum that provides students with the foundation of interdisciplinary knowledge, breadth, methods and the approaches necessary for successful professional education. These courses are also expected to enhance students' critical analytical skills in reading, writing, speech and thinking, and contribute to their preparation for post-university life.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To fulfill the Environmental and Urban Change general education requirements students must take 12 general education credits as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>6.00 credits in humanities (HUMA), which may be satisfied by taking EU/ENVS 1010 3.00 and EU/ENVS 1100 3.00 or any other 1000-level humanities general education course (at least 6 credits) not listed as satisfying the social science requirement;</li>
	<li>6.00 credit in social science, which may be satisfied by taking EU/GEOG 1000 6.00 or any other 1000-level social sciences general education course (at least 6 credits) not listed as satisfying the humanities requirement.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Guidelines for General Education Courses</h4>

<p>It is strongly recommended that students successfully complete (pass) their general education course within their first 24 credits, if not possible, all general education courses must be completed within the first 48 credits.</p>

<p>Where a credit might count towards either the general education requirement or the major requirement, it may only count towards one or the other and not both towards the total number of credits required for the degree.</p>

<p>All general education courses are offered at the 1000 level.</p>

<p>General education course substitutions may be offered by any school or department in the Faculty of Liberal Arts &amp; Professional Studies (LA&amp;PS). Please contact your academic advisor at <a href="mailto:euadvise@yorku.ca">euadvise@yorku.ca</a> for the list of approved general educations courses.</p>

<h4>Major Credits</h4>

<p>In addition to taking courses which contribute to their broad knowledge, students are required to specialize in a specific subject. Students may choose to major in a specific subject when they enter the University, or they may wait until they have completed up to 24 credits. At this point, students must choose a major, but subsequent changes are possible. In selecting courses, students who are undecided&nbsp; are recommended to take introductory courses in a number of potential major subjects. This will allow them to proceed in their eventual major of choice while minimizing delay.<br />
<br />
Cross-listed courses may not be double counted in order to fulfil major requirements. For example, if EU/ENVS 3891 3.00 is cross-listed to AP/HIST 3891 3.00, it may be counted as a environmental studies course or a history course, but not as both.</p>

<h4>Upper-level Credits</h4>

<p>The Faculty also considers it good educational practice to ensure that students take a number of credits at the 3000 level and/or 4000 level. Though it may vary by program, students must take at&nbsp; least 9 credits at the 3000 level and 18 credits at the 4000 level. (A course's level is indicated by the first digit of its number.)</p>

<h4>Credits Outside the Major</h4>

<p>Credits outside the major are courses which are intended to broaden the educational experience of students beyond their area of specialization. Credits outside the major include most courses which are not used to fulfil the general education requirements or major/minor requirements, and include free electives. Please refer to Programs of Study section for program-specific information.</p>

<h4>Minimum Requirements by Program Type</h4>

<p>The following minimum requirements apply to all Environmental and Urban Change students. Each program of study (major) may stipulate additional requirements. For details of individual programs, refer to the Programs of Study section. Also consult the section on Academic Standing.<br />
<br />
In order to graduate with an BA degree, students must achieve satisfactory academic standing to enter, proceed and graduate and must successfully complete (pass) a minimum of 90 credits which fulfil all of the following requirements.<br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>Graduation requirement:</strong> students must successfully complete (pass) at least 90 credits that meet the Faculty's degree and program requirements with a cumulative grade point average of at least 4.00;<br />

<h4>Major Credits</h4>

<p>In addition to taking courses which contribute to their broad knowledge, students are required to specialize in a specific subject or combination of subjects. The area of primary concentration is known as the major; an area of secondary concentration (if applicable) is known as either a double major or a minor. In a double major program a course may count towards only one major. In a major/minor program, a course may count only for major credit or for minor credit.</p>

<p>Students may choose to major or minor in a specific subject when they enter the University or they may wait until they have completed up to 24 credits.

<p>Students in the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change may also combine an Honours Double Major BA or BES or Honours Major/Minor BA or BES program with the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies. For further details, about the program requirements in the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies, students should consult the Faculty.</p>

<h5>Faculty of Science</h5>

<p>Students in the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change may combine any Honours Major/Minor BA or BES program with the Faculty of Science.</p>

<p>Honours Minor Program Option: Biology, Earth and Atmospheric Science, Chemistry, Math, Physics and Astronomy. For details about the program requirements in the Faculty of Science, students should consult the Faculty.</p>

<h5>School of the Arts, Media, Performance and Design</h5>

<p>Students in the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change may combine any Honours Major/Minor BA or BES program with the School of the Arts, Media, Performance and Design. For details about those program requirements, students should consult the School of the Arts, Media, Performance and Design.</p>

<h5>Co-registration in the Faculty of Education</h5>

<p>Students enrolled in a BA program in the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change may apply for admission to the Pre-Service program of the Faculty of Education. If they are accepted, they may co-register in the Faculty of Education and upon successful completion of the separate degree requirements of both Faculties will be awarded two degrees: Honours Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Education (BEd).</p>

<p>Although Environmental and Urban Change courses are taken concurrently with Education courses, they are counted separately by each Faculty. Grade point averages for courses in the two Faculties are also calculated separately. The 30 credits required for the BEd are independent of the 120 credits required for the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change Honours BA. Therefore, a student completing the requirements for both degrees would need to complete a minimum total of 150 credits for the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change Honours BA/BEd.</p>

<h5>Credit for Education Courses</h5>

<p>Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change students who are co-registered in the Faculty of Education may count education courses taken beyond the requirements for the BEd for credit towards the Honours BA degree as credits outside the major.</p>

<p>Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change students who are not co-registered in the Faculty of Education may receive degree credit for academic courses offered by the Faculty of Education as credits outside the major.</p>

            <div><h4>General Education</h4>

<p>The Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change is committed to ensuring that all students are exposed to the Humanities, the Social Sciences and the Natural Sciences through ensuring a robust General Education requirement. The general education requirement provides a broad perspective on current scholarship and the diversity of human experience. We strive to provide a broader general education curriculum that provides students with the foundation of interdisciplinary knowledge, breadth, methods and the approaches necessary for successful professional education. These courses are also expected to enhance students' critical analytical skills in reading, writing, speech and thinking, and contribute to their preparation for post-university life.<br />
<br />
To fulfill the Environmental and Urban Change general education requirements, students must take 12 general education credits as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>6.00 credits in humanities (HUMA), which may be satisfied by taking EU/ENVS 1010 3.00 and EU/ENVS 1100 3.00 or any other 1000-level humanities general education course (at least 6 credits) not listed as either satisfying the social science;</li>
	<li>6.00 credit in social science which may be satisfied by taking EU/GEOG 1000 6.00 or any other 1000-level social sciences general education course (at least 6 credits) not listed as satisfying the humanities requirement.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Guidelines for General Education Courses</h4>

<p>It is strongly recommended that students successfully complete (pass) their general education course within their first 24 credits. All general education courses must be completed within the first 48 credits.</p>

<p>Where a credit might count towards either the general education requirement or the major requirement, it may only count towards one or the other and not both.</p>

<p>All general education courses are offered at the 1000 level.</p>

<p>General education course substitutions may be offered by any school or department in the Faculty of Liberal Arts &amp; Professional Studies (LA&amp;PS). Please contact your academic advisor at <a href="mailto:euadvise@yorku.ca">euadvise@yorku.ca</a> for the list of approved general educations courses.</p>

<h4>Major Credits</h4>

<p>In addition to taking courses which contribute to their broad knowledge, students are required to specialize in a specific subject. Students may choose to major in a specific subject when they enter the University, or they may wait until they have completed up to 24 credits. At this point, students must choose a major, but subsequent changes are possible. In selecting courses, students who are undecided are recommended to take introductory courses in a number of potential major subjects. This will allow them to proceed in their eventual major of choice while minimizing delay.<br />
<br />
Cross-listed courses may not be double counted in order to fulfil major requirements. For example, if EU/ENVS 3891 3.00 is cross-listed to AP/HIST 3891 3.00, it may be counted as a environmental studies course or a history course, but not as both.</p>

<h4>Upper-level Credits</h4>

<p>The Faculty also considers it good educational practice to ensure that students take a number of credits at the 3000 level and/or 4000 level. Though it may vary by program, students must take at least at least 18 credits at the 3000 level or 4000 level . (A course's level is indicated by the first digit of its number.)</p>

<h4>Credits Outside the Major</h4>

<p>Credits outside the major are courses which are intended to broaden the educational experience of students beyond their area of specialization. Credits outside the major include most courses which are not used to fulfil the general education requirements or major/minor requirements, and include free electives. Please refer to the Programs of Study section for program-specific information.</p>

<h4>Minimum Requirements by Program Type</h4>

<p>The following minimum requirements apply to all Environmental and Urban Change students. Each program of study (major) may stipulate additional requirements. For details of individual programs, refer to the Programs of Study section. Also consult the section on Academic Standing.<br />
<br />
In order to graduate with a BSc degree, students must achieve satisfactory academic standing to enter, proceed and graduate and must successfully complete (pass) a minimum of 90 credits which fulfil all of the following requirements.<br />
<br />
<strong>Residency requirement:</strong> a minimum of 30 course credits and at least half (50 per cent) of the course credits required in each undergraduate degree program major/minor must be taken at York University;<br />
<br />
<strong>Graduation requirement:</strong> students must successfully complete (pass) at least 90 credits that meet the Faculty's degree and program requirements with a cumulative grade point average of at least 4.00;<br />

              <div>
            <div><p>While working towards the completion of the BA or BES or BSc degree, students may opt to pursue a certificate in addition to their degree program. Students can choose from Climate Solutions and Sustainable Energy (CCSE); or Geomatics: Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing (GIS). In order to do so, students are required to complete a number of required and elective courses, in addition to completing other degree requirements. Please refer to Programs of Study section for certificate program-specific information. Contact the Faculty at <a href="mailto:euadvise@yorku.ca">euadvise@yorku.ca</a> for more information on applying to these certificate programs.</p>

              <div>
            <div><h3>Minimum Requirements for Multiple Certificates</h3>

<p>Students may acquire more than one certificate during the course of their studies, provided that at least 18 credits in each certificate program are unique to the specific certificate.</p>

<h3>Residency Requirements</h3>

<p>York University's residency requirement for undergraduate certificate programs is 18 credits for certificate programs requiring up to 36 credits, and 50 per cent of the required credits for certificates comprising more than 36 credits. Normally, for undergraduate certificate programs requiring 18 credits or less, all credits are completed at York.</p>

<h3>Admission/Graduation Application and Transcript Notation</h3>

<p>Students seeking direct entry to a certificate program must submit a written application when applying for admission to the University. Students already enrolled in an undergraduate degree program are also expected to apply for entry to a certificate program, normally prior to completion of 36 credits of their undergraduate degree program. Students must also submit an application to graduate from a certificate program. Applications should be obtained from and filed with the unit administering the certificate program. Transcript notation that the requirements for a certificate have been completed will be made once the Registrar’s Office has received notice from the unit administering the program. Certificates will not be conferred until candidates have successfully completed an undergraduate degree program if they are simultaneously enrolled in a degree and a certificate program.</p>

<h3>Certificates in the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change</h3>

<p>There are multiple certificates associated with the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://euc.yorku.ca/continuing-studies/certificate-in-climate-solutions-and-sustainable-energy/">Certificate in Climate Solutions and Sustainable Energy (CCSE)</a></li>

              <div>
            <div><h3>Information for Continuing Students in a Grandparented Program (Admitted Prior to Fall/Winter 2021-2022)</h3>

<p>Students who were registered in a degree and program formerly in the Department of Geography in the Faculty of Liberal and Professional Studies (BA) and the former Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change (BES) have been moved to the newly-created Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change. Grandparenting provisions have been developed for students continuing in these degrees and programs. Continuing students who are moved to the new Faculty will be permitted to complete their existing degrees and programs of study under the grandparenting rules.</p>

<p>The University is committed to ensuring a minimum disruption to students through adherence to grandparenting principles. The grandparenting rules outlined below will be in effect until Summer 2026, with Fall 2026 convocation being the final sunset date. Students who have not completed the requirements of their grandparented program by the end of the Summer 2026 session will be required to follow the program adopted in the new Faculty. Consequently, all students enrolled in the Fall/Winter 2026-2027 session will be following new Faculty requirements.</p>

<h3>Enrolment in new Faculty</h3>

<p>The academic year of 2025-2026, which includes the Fall/Winter 2025-2026 and the Summer 2026 sessions, is the final year in which students may complete their programs of study under the grandparented rules of their former Faculty. The Summer 2023 session is the final session in which students from the former Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change and from the Department of Geography in the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies can be reactivated into their current programs under the grandparented rules. Students reactivating in subsequent sessions will be required to follow the rules implemented by the new Faculty.</p>

<h3>Grandparenting requirements</h3>

<p>University and Faculty-level degree requirements include the number of credits for the degree, general education requirements, breadth requirements (if any), grade point average (overall, cumulative and sessional) requirements and residence/in-Faculty requirements. Program of study requirements include rules about program-specific regulations such as the number of courses for a Major/Minor, the number of courses at a particular level, and specific individual course requirements. At the course level, grandparenting rules will take into consideration course levels, course content and course substitutes. It is assumed that, if necessary, discretion will be used in order to accommodate any students inadvertently disadvantaged by the rules implemented by the new Faculty.</p>

<h3>University, Faculty-level and program of study requirements</h3>

<p>BA and BES students who have been moved to the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change, will not be able to transfer back to the former Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change or the Department of Geography in the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies, since those units no longer exist. However, current students will be permitted to continue in their existing degrees and programs of study in the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change following grandparented rules.</p>

<p>Students will be able to follow grandparented rules until the end of the Summer 2026 session with Fall 2026 being the final convocation for programs under grandparented rules. Students who have not completed programs with grandparented rules by the end of Summer 2026 session will be required to complete degrees and programs under rules implemented by the new Faculty.</p>

<p>Students who are moved to the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change will be transferred into a program of study that corresponds to the program of study they were pursuing in the former Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change or Department of Geography in the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies. Students who opt to change their program of study in the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change once moved will follow the new program rules. Students who are declaring their Major effective for the Fall/Winter 2021-2022 session must choose a program of study in the new Faculty rather than choosing from the set of grandparented programs. Students who change from a program of study with a single Major to a new program of study with a Double Major or a new program with a Major/Minor option will follow the rules established for the new program of study. Students who are inadvertently disadvantaged by the rules of the new program of study at the time of graduation will be accommodated by the rules of the new program of study.</p>

<h3>Faculty transfers</h3>

<p>Students transferring from units other than the former Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change and the Department of Geography in the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies to the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change effective September 1, 2021 will be required to follow the new rules implemented by the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change.</p>

<h3>Reactivation for grandparented rules</h3>

<p>Previous students from the former Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change and the Department of Geography in the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies who have been away for fewer than four consecutive sessions (2 academic years or less) and who reactivate before the Summer 2023 session will be eligible to follow grandparented rules from their original program. Students will be able to follow these grandparented rules until convocation in Fall 2026; Summer 2026 will be the final academic term for the grandparented rules. Students who have not completed their program requirements under the grandparented rules as of the Summer 2026 session will be required to complete their degrees and programs under the rules implemented by the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change.</p>

<h3>Reactivations to new rules</h3>

<p>Previous students from the former Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change and the Department of Geography in the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies who have been away for more than four consecutive sessions (2 academic years or less), or who reactivate after the Summer 2023 session will follow the rules in place at the time of reactivation.</p>

<h3>Residence requirements/in-Faculty requirements</h3>

<p>For students moved to the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change, courses taken in the former Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change and in the Department of Geography in the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies will be deemed to count towards the residence or in-Faculty requirements.</p>

<h3>Courses</h3>

<p>The Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change will develop a clear policy for grandparented programs of study with regard to course-level requirements and course substitutes. Students completing degrees and programs of study under grandparented rules will have their previous courses' levels and substitutes honoured.</p>

<p>Students must successfully complete (pass) at least 120 credits, meet Faculty and program requirements, and achieve a CGPA of 5.00 (C+) for all courses taken to satisfy their program in order to graduate with an Honours degree. Students who are permitted to continue in an Honours program on warning will be required to attend an advising appointment with their advisor prior to enrolling.</p>

<h3>Courses Taken Beyond the Normal Maximum</h3>

<p>Students in an Honours BES/BA/BSc program who successfully complete more than 120 credits and whose cumulative grade point average is at least 5.00 (C+) will have all credits counted towards their Honours BES/BA/BSc and their cumulative grade point average.</p>

<h3>Graduating in Honours BES/BA/BSc</h3>

<p>To graduate from an Honours program, students must successfully complete (pass) at least 120 credits which meet the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change' program requirements. The cumulative grade point average for all courses taken must be at least 5.00 (C+).</p>

<h3>Ineligibility to Continue in Honours BES/BA/BSc</h3>

<p>Students who do not meet the conditions outlined above may continue their studies only in the Bachelor’s 90 credit degree program. Students will be automatically transferred to the Bachelor’s program.</p>

<p><strong>Re-entering Honours:</strong> Students may re-enter Honours BES/BA/BSc if they raise their cumulative grade point average to 5.00 or above by the time they have successfully completed (passed) their 90th credit. No extra courses may be taken in a subsequent session in an effort to raise the grade point average to qualify for Honours. Please refer to the Academic Warnings and Penalties section.</p>

<h3>Opting to Graduate in the BES/BA/BSc Program – 90 credit</h3>

<p>Students who are enrolled in the 120-credit Honours program may opt to graduate with a 90-credit degree program if they fulfill those program requirements.

<h4>Additional Credits to Raise Cumulative Grade Point Average to Meet the Requirements for Graduation</h4>

<p>Students in the BES/BA/BSc&nbsp;program who have passed 90 credits in accordance with the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change program requirements, but whose cumulative grade point average is below 4.00 (C), will be allowed a maximum of 12 additional credits beyond the 90 credits to a maximum of 102 credits, in an effort to increase their cumulative grade point average to qualify to graduate. &nbsp;These courses must be above the 1000 level and a minimum of six credits must be taken in EUC; regulations on equivalent and excluded courses apply. New courses, repeated courses, passed courses and failed courses will count towards the total maximum number of attempted credits. These courses must be taken at York University.</p>

<h3>Academic Standing Requirements for Visiting Students</h3>

<p>Individuals who wish to enrol in undergraduate credit courses, but who do not intend to complete a degree or a certificate may be admitted to York as a visiting student (see the Admissions section for more information). <a href="https://futurestudents.yorku.ca/requirements/visiting">futurestudents.yorku.ca/requirements/visiting</a></p>

<p>Students whose overall cumulative grade point average falls below 4.00 (C) at the end of any session or who enter the Faculty with a grade point average equivalent to less than 4.00 (C) on the York University undergraduate grading scheme, receive an academic warning. Students who receive an academic warning must achieve an overall cumulative grade point average of at least 4.00 (C) within the next 24 credits taken or must earn a sessional grade point average of at least 5.00 (C+) in the session in which the 24th credit is completed and in each subsequent session until the cumulative average reaches 4.00 (C) or be required to withdraw for 2 academic sessions (SU and FW or FW and SU).</p>

<h3>Required Withdrawal BES/BA/BSc</h3>

<p>Students whose academic record show marked weaknesses may be required to withdraw from their studies for one year, during which time they are encouraged to identify and remedy any problems which may have contributed to their failure to perform up to their potential, and to reflect on their reasons for pursuing a university education. The following regulations apply to required withdrawals for 2 academic sessions (SU and FW or FW and SU).</p>

<h3>Grade Point Average Below 3.00 (D+)</h3>

<p>Students whose cumulative grade point average on at least 24 credits is below 3.00 must withdraw for 12 months.</p>

<h3>Grade Point Average Below 4.00 (C) and Greater than or equal to 3.00 (D+)</h3>

<p>Students who have received an academic warning for a cumulative grade point average below 4.00 (C) must achieve a cumulative grade point average of at least 4.00 (C) within their next 24 credits taken or earn a sessional grade point average of at least 5.00 (C+) in the session in which the 24th credit is completed and in each subsequent session until the cumulative average reaches 4.00 (C); otherwise, they must withdraw for 12 months. Should the student’s cumulative grade point average fall below 3.00 (D+) at any time after completion of 24 credits, they will be required to withdraw.</p>

<h3>Petition to Continue Without Interruption</h3>

<p>Students who have been required to withdraw may submit a petition to the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change requesting permission to continue their studies without interruption. Students granted such a petition would be allowed to continue their studies on debarment warning. For further information, contact the Office of Student and Academic Services, 137 HNES.</p>

<h3>Reactivation after Required Withdrawal</h3>

<p>Students who have been required to withdraw may apply for reactivation (to continue their studies) after the requisite period of absence by submitting a request online at the Reactivation Web page (<a href="https://registrar.yorku.ca/enrol/reactivate">registrar.yorku.ca/enrol/reactivate</a>). Students who return to their studies after such a required withdrawal (as well as those who have been allowed to continue their studies by virtue of a petition to the EUC Petitions Committee) will receive a debarment warning.</p>

<h3>Debarment Warning</h3>

<p>Students who have been required to withdraw from the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change or from another Faculty at York or elsewhere receive will receive a debarment warning upon returning or continuing their studies in the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change. Students on a debarment warning must achieve a cumulative grade point average of at least 4.00 (C) within the next 24 credits taken or earn a sessional grade point average of at least 5.00 (C+) in the session in which the 24th credit is completed and in each subsequent session until their cumulative average reaches 4.00 (C), and must then maintain this average. Students who do not fulfill these conditions will be debarred from the University. Students whose cumulative grade point average falls below 3.00 (D+) at any time while on a debarment warning will be debarred.</p>

<h3>Debarment</h3>

<p>Students who have already been required to withdraw because of their unsatisfactory academic record and whose record does not show improvement will be debarred from the University. Debarment, the minimum period for which is normally two years, means that a student is no longer a student at York University.</p>

<h3>Petition to Continue Without Interruption</h3>

<p>Students who have been debarred may submit a petition to the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change Petitions Committee requesting permission to continue their studies without interruption. For further information, contact the Office of Student and Academic Services, 137 HNES.</p>

<h3>Reapplying After Debarment</h3>

<p>Students who have been debarred and who wish to resume their studies must apply for re-admission through the Admissions Office <a href="https://futurestudents.yorku.ca">futurestudents.yorku.ca</a> and must provide persuasive evidence that they are ready and able to complete a degree program. Students who are re-admitted (as well as those who have been allowed to continue their studies by virtue of a petition) are deemed to be on academic probation</p>

<h3>Academic Probation</h3>

<p>Students who have been debarred and who subsequently resume their studies in the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change by petitioning to continue without interruption or by reapplying for admission are deemed to be on academic probation. The conditions for continuing while on an academic probation are the same as those for a debarment warning.</p>

<h3>Debarment warning conditions</h3>

<p>Students who have been debarred may submit a petition to the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change Undergraduate Pedagogy, Academic Standards, and Awards Committee (UG PASA) requesting permission to continue their studies without interruption. Students granted such a petition would be allowed to continue their studies on academic probation warning. For further information, contact the Office of Student and Academic Services, 137 HNES.</p>

            <div><h3>Grading</h3>

<p>The Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change follows the York University undergraduate grading scheme which awards letters ranging from A+ to F and assigns a point value from 0 to 9 to each letter grade. Where percentages are used as a means of reporting grades on individual pieces of work, the conversion table below is to be used in converting percentage grades to letter grades, unless alternative provisions for scaling and/or conversion are announced to students in writing within the first two weeks of classes.</p>

<ol>
	<li>All course grades, including those assigned after a deferred examination(s) are derived from an evaluation of examination and term work, unless otherwise decided.</li>
	<li>With the exception of courses explicitly required for certification by a professional body, or other exceptions agreed to by Senate, students pass or fail a course on the basis of final course average, without the additional requirement of having to obtain a passing grade on a final examination. (This does not preclude the possibility of a final examination representing more than 50 per cent of the final grade in a particular course or the requirement that a student pass a specific course lab component.)</li>
	<li>Unless Senate agrees to explicit exemptions, eligibility to proceed in or graduate from an undergraduate degree program will not be based on a minimum grade requirement for each major course. It should be noted that this does not preclude setting requirements for a minimum cumulative grade point average in a major subject area. Nor does this preclude setting individual course grade requirements when a course is a prerequisite for upper-level courses or as part of a core requirement. Course grades are not official until released by the University.</li>
	<li>The letter-grade system is the fundamental system of assessment of performance in undergraduate programs at York University. In courses where percentages are used as a means of reporting grades on individual pieces of work, the following conversion table is to be used in converting percentage grades to letter grades, unless alternative provisions for scaling and/or conversion are announced to students in writing within the first two weeks of classes.</li>

<h3>Repeated Passed or Failed Courses</h3>

<p>Students may repeat a passed or failed course twice for academic degree or certificate credit, for a maximum of three (3) attempts at a course. Students should note that course availability and space considerations may preclude the possibility of repeating a course in the session they choose.</p>

<p>Credit towards your degree will only be counted once for repeated courses taken at York or elsewhere. All repeated passed or failed attempts are subject to the University <a href="https://calendars.students.yorku.ca/2023-2024/policy-on-repeating-passed-or-failed-courses-for-academic-credit">Senate Policy on Repeating Passed or Failed Courses For Academic Credit</a>.</p>

<p>The means of determining the final grade in a course shall be provided to students by the course director within the first two weeks of class. Such information must include the types of assignments, essays, examinations, and other components, which make up the grade, their relative weight(s), and any other procedures, which enter into the determination of the final grade.</p>

<h3>Subsequent changes:</h3>

<p>In exceptional circumstances, a previously announced marking scheme for a course may be changed, but only with the consent of the majority of students and the approval of the undergraduate program director. The course director must distribute the new marking scheme in written form to the students.</p>

<h3>Feedback during course:</h3>

<p>Course directors are obliged to provide a mechanism by which students can be apprised of their progress in a course and that the grading scheme (i.e. kinds and weights or assignments, essays, exams etc.) be announced, and be available in writing, within the first two weeks of class. Under normal circumstances, graded feedback worth at least 15 per cent of the final grade for fall, winter or summer term, and 30 per cent for "full year" courses offered in the fall/winter term, be received by students in all courses prior to the final withdrawal date from a course without receiving a grade, with the following exceptions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>graduate or upper-level undergraduate courses where course work typically or at the instructor's discretion, consists of a single piece of work and/or is based predominantly (or solely) on student presentations (e.g. honours theses or graduate research papers not due by the drop date etc.);</li>
	<li>practicum courses;</li>
	<li>ungraded courses;</li>
	<li>courses in Faculties where the drop date occurs within the first three weeks of classes;</li>
	<li>courses which run on a compressed schedule (a course which accomplishes its academic credits of work at a rate of more than one credit hour per two calendar weeks).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> under unusual and/or unforeseeable circumstances which disrupt the academic norm, course directors are expected to provide grading schemes and academic feedback in the spirit of these regulations, as soon as possible.</p>

            <div><p>Please refer to the <em>Policies and Regulations</em> section of the <a href="https://calendars.students.yorku.ca/policies-and-regulations">Undergraduate Calendar</a> for further information about grade reappraisals.</p>

<h3>Reappraisal of Final Course Grades</h3>

<p>Students may, with sufficient academic grounds, request that a final grade in a course be reappraised (which may mean the review of specific pieces of tangible work). Non-academic grounds are not relevant for grade reappraisals; in such cases, students are advised to petition to their home Faculty. Students are normally expected to first contact the course director to discuss the grade received and to request that their tangible work be reviewed. Tangible work may include written, graphic, digitized, modeled, video recording or audio recording formats, but not oral work.</p>

<p>Students need to be aware that a request for a grade reappraisal may result in the original grade being raised, lowered or confirmed.</p>

<p>In the event that students are still not satisfied with the final grade or the course director is not available to review the work, they may submit in writing a formal request for a grade reappraisal to the department or unit in which the course is offered*. The Senate approved deadline for submitting grade reappraisals is within three weeks of the release of final grade reports in any term. Exercising discretion about minor delays in meeting the deadline which result from slow mail delivery or extraordinary circumstances is reasonable.</p>

<p>*<em>The exceptions are as follows</em>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>For courses offered by Osgoode Hall Law School, Schulich School of Business and the Faculty of Education, the requests for reappraisal are submitted to the office of the relevant associate dean.</li>
	<li>If the condition of sufficient academic grounds has been met, the relevant department committee, department Chair, associate dean or graduate/undergraduate program director will be responsible for ensuring that the work is reappraised by an appropriate faculty member, ensuring anonymity of both the student and the reappraiser and for communicating the result of the reappraisal (including the reappraiser’s comments) and the route of appeal to both the student and the course director. The reappraiser will be given the nature of the assignment and the rationale for the original grade. It is expected that every effort will be made to render the decision within 30 days of the reviewer having received the work.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Date by Which to Request a Grade Reappraisal</h3>

<p>Requests for grade reappraisals must be submitted by the scheduled date for the term in which a course is completed and the grade released.</p>

<p>In the event that students is not satisfied with the final grade or the course director is not available to review the work, students may submit in writing a formal request for a grade reappraisal to the department or unit in which the course is offered*. The Senate-approved deadline for submitting grade reappraisals is February 15 for fall term grades, June 15 for fall/winter session and winter term grades, September 30 for summer session grades, or a minimum of 21 days from the release of grades, whichever is later. When a submission deadline occurs on a weekend or holiday, requests will be accepted up until the end of the next available business day. Exercising discretion about minor delays in meeting the deadline, resulting from slow mail delivery or extraordinary circumstances, is reasonable.</p>

<p>Whenever the grade reappraisal reflects a grade change it will be annotated on the student's transcript. All grade reappraisal is subject to the <a href="https://myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/">University policy on grade reappraisal</a>.</p>

<h3>Further Appeal for Reappraisal of a Final Course Grade</h3>

<p>If the student is not satisfied with a reappraised final course grade, the procedure shall be as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the course director, if available, and the student shall discuss the matter with the undergraduate program director, who may or may not arrange another reappraisal;</li>
	<li>if the matter remains unresolved, with sufficient academic grounds, request that a final grade in a course be reappraised (which may mean the review of specific pieces of tangible work. Tangible work may include written, graphic, digitized, modelled, video recording or audio recording formats, but not oral work. Non-academic grounds are not relevant for grade reappraisals; in such cases, students are advised to petition.</li>
	<li>the student may appeal the grade by submitting an official grade reappraisal request on the appropriate form provided by the Office of Student and Academic Services to the Undergraduate Pedagogy, Academic Standards, and Awards Committee (UG PASA), clearly stating the grounds for appeal and the assignment(s) to be reassessed;</li>
	<li>the decision of the Undergraduate Pedagogy, Academic Standards, and Awards Committee (UG PASA) shall be final and may be appealed to the UG PASA Appeals Sub-Committee only on grounds of procedural irregularity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reappraisal of Grades Other Than Final Course Grades</h3>

<p>If a student is not satisfied with any grade — other than a final course grade — received from an instructor or teaching assistant, the student is expected to discuss the matter (and at such time may request a reappraisal) with the person from whom the student received the grade, normally within two weeks. A reappraisal may result in a lower, higher or unchanged grade. If the student is not satisfied with the result of the reappraisal, the instructor or teaching assistant (where appropriate) shall discuss the matter with the course director. The course director shall decide whether or not to reappraise the student’s work and the decision is final for all grades other than final course grades.</p>

            <div><h3>Term Work</h3>

<p>Term work includes reports, assignments, essays, tests, and other written and oral work assigned in a course, with the exception of final examinations, as outlined in the approved course syllabus. Course directors set the deadlines for submission of term work. All term work must be submitted by the last day of classes of the term in which the course ends. Term work submitted after the last day of classes of the term in which the course ends will not be accepted for grading. Notwithstanding that term work will not be accepted after the last day of classes of the term in which the course ends, assignments received later than the due date will be penalized five per cent of the value of the assignment per day that their assignments are late. Exceptions to the lateness policy for valid reasons such as illness, compassionate grounds etc. will be entertained by the course director only when supported by written documentation (e.g. a doctor's letter).</p>

<h3>Ethical Review of Undergraduate Course Research Involving Human Participants: EUC Procedures</h3>

<p>York students are subject to the York University Policy for the ethics review process for research involving human participants. All research activity with human participants and minimal risk as part of this course has to undergo ethical review. Please consider the following definitions:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Human participants in research will be defined as persons who provide data or information to the researcher which are typically not part of their professional capacity.</li>
	<li>The draft definition of funded research from the Human Participants Review Sub-Committee [HPRC] is: “‘Funded’ will refer to all research that is receiving money that is in response to a specific proposal and administered by the university. Research using monies not administered by the University, and/or not in response to a specific proposal, will be considered ‘unfunded’.”</li>
	<li>The definition of minimal risk being used is the one given in the SSHRC/NSERC/CIHR Tri-Council Policy Statement on Ethical Conduct for Research involving Humans 2 (2018): “’minimal risk’ research is defined as research in which the probability and magnitude of possible harms implied by participation in the research are no greater than those encountered by participants in those aspects of their everyday life that relate to the research.”</li>
</ol>

<h3>Tests and Examinations</h3>

<p>Tests and examinations may be held in any EUC &nbsp;course in such form and manner as decided by the course director and as described in the approved course syllabus. Tests and examinations are an essential part of the learning and evaluation process. They must be conducted under fair conditions which allow students to analyze, synthesize, and demonstrate what they have learned. Disruptions or attempts to obtain an unfair advantage are offences against due academic processes and carry severe penalties: refer to the <em>Senate Policy on Academic Honesty</em> and the <em>Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities</em> at <u><a href="https://secretariat-policies.info.yorku.ca/" title="http://secretariat-policies.info.yorku.ca/">secretariat-policies.info.yorku.ca</a></u>.&nbsp;The following regulations apply to tests and examinations (<u><a href="https://secretariat-policies.info.yorku.ca/policies/conduct-of-examinations-policy-guidelines/" title="http://secretariat-policies.info.yorku.ca/policies/conduct-of-examinations-policy-guidelines/">secretariat-policies.info.yorku.ca/policies/conduct-of-examinations-policy-guidelines/</a></u>).</p>

<h4>End of term restrictions:</h4>

<p>The total value of any test(s) or examination(s) given during the final 14 calendar days of classes in a term must carry a combined weighting of no more than 20 per cent of the final mark for the course. <strong>Note:</strong> exceptions are made for some third- and fourth-year courses, such as seminars that often have one or two major assignments due at the end of the term.</p>

<h4>Scheduling of tests:</h4>

<p>Except where testing is conducted during individual appointments which accommodate a student's schedule (e.g. individually scheduled make-up tests), tests or examinations given during the term must be held within the hours regularly scheduled for the course in question. Any exceptions must be communicated within the first two weeks of classes and on the course outline.</p>

<h4>Students' rights of refusal:</h4>

<p>Students who are asked to write tests or examinations in contravention of the preceding two regulations may refuse to do so without academic penalty. They also have the right to raise the matter with the Undergraduate Program Director of the department or the school in which the course is offered or with the associate dean of students.</p>

<h4>General Regulations for Tests and Examinations</h4>

<h5>Identification</h5>

<p>Students who are being tested or examined are required to present a valid York University photo identification card or other acceptable form of photo identification and to sign the attendance roster for the examination. Acceptable forms of photographic identification include a valid driver's license with photograph attached, a valid passport or other certificate of citizenship with photograph attached.</p>

<h5>Answer Booklets</h5>

<p>Answer booklets are the property of the University. Test papers, examination booklets and other answer forms remain the property of the University unless they are released by an instructor. Students may not remove them from the test or examination room without permission; nor may they possess blank examination booklets.</p>

<h5>Students’ Right to Review</h5>

<p>Students may always have the opportunity, under properly controlled conditions, to review and discuss their graded test and examination answers, but final examination answer booklets (and at the discretion of the course director, other examination booklets) remain the property of the University, and are retained by the teaching unit for a certain period of time before they are destroyed.</p>

<h5>Final examination period</h5>

<p>There is a final examination period at the end of each term. The dates and times of formally scheduled examinations are listed on the York Courses website at <u><a href="https://w2prod.sis.yorku.ca/Apps/WebObjects/cdm.woa/wa/curexam" title="https://w2prod.sis.yorku.ca/Apps/WebObjects/cdm.woa/wa/curexam">w2prod.sis.yorku.ca/Apps/WebObjects/cdm.woa/wa/curexam</a></u>. Examinations may last two or three hours. Students are responsible for making themselves aware of the appropriate examination details.</p>

<h5>Missed examinations</h5>

<p>In accordance with University policy and procedure, a student who misses an examination should contact the course director and the department/school of the examination as soon as possible. A student who wishes to write a make-up examination must request deferred standing in the course. Please refer to the section on Deferred Standing/Academic Petitions and Appeals or the Deferred Standing web page at <u><a href="https://myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/deferred-standing" title="https://registrar.yorku.ca/exams/deferred">myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/deferred-standing</a></u></p>

<h5>Religious Accommodation Guidelines</h5>

<p>Students who, because of religious commitment cannot write a formally scheduled examination (December and April or Summer examination periods) on the date scheduled, should contact the course instructor <strong>no later than three weeks prior to the start of the examination period</strong> to arrange an alternative examination date. A Religious Accommodation form is available for this purpose online at <u><a href="https://w2prod.sis.yorku.ca/Apps/WebObjects/cdm.woa/wa/regobs" title="https://w2prod.sis.yorku.ca/Apps/WebObjects/cdm.woa/wa/regobs">w2prod.sis.yorku.ca/Apps/WebObjects/cdm.woa/wa/regobs</a></u>.</p>

<h5>Rewriting of examinations</h5>

<p>The Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change has no provision for rewriting of a final examination. Once an exam&nbsp; &nbsp;been written or the major paper submitted, the course is completed. Examinations or papers cannot be rewritten to improve a final grade. There shall be no rewriting to improve a mark.</p>

<h4>Assessment of Students in EUC Courses</h4>

<p>The course director shall assess students enrolled in each EUC course considering the requirements set at the beginning of the course as articulated in the course syllabus. These assessments shall be based on a combination of tests or formal examination(s), participation in classes, term work submitted, and other evidence as determined by the course director.</p>

<h5>Subsequent Changes</h5>

<p>In exceptional circumstances, a previously announced marking scheme for a course may be changed, but only with the consent of all students and the approval of the Undergraduate Program Director. The Course Director must distribute the new marking scheme in written form to the students.</p>

<p>In courses where percentages are used as a means of reporting grades on individual pieces of work, the conversion table is used in converting percentage grades to letter grades, unless alternative provisions for scaling and/or conversion are announced to students in writing within the first two weeks of classes.</p>

<h5>Feedback During Course</h5>

<p>Course Directors are obliged to provide a mechanism by which students can be apprised of their progress in a course. The grading scheme (i.e. kinds and weights of assignments, essays, exams, etc.) will be announced, and be available in writing, within the first two weeks of class. Under normal circumstances, graded feedback worth at least 15% of the final grade for Fall, Winter or Summer Term, and 30% for ‘full year’ courses offered in the Fall/Winter Term, will be received by students in all courses prior to the final withdrawal date from a course without receiving a grade, with the following exceptions:</p>

            <div><h3>Breach of Academic Honesty</h3>

<p>Conduct that violates the ethical or legal standards of the University community is a serious matter. In particular, any breach of academic honesty is a most serious offence to both the University community and the academic enterprise. Therefore, all faculty members are required to treat any breach of academic honesty, no matter how small the breach may appear, as a most serious matter demanding most thorough investigation. The rules embodied in the University <a href="https://secretariat-policies.info.yorku.ca/policies/academic-honesty-senate-policy-on/">Senate Policy on Academic Honesty</a> apply to all BES/BA/BSc students and are described in the Policies and Regulations section of this publication.</p>

<p>In the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change it is a serious offence against academic honesty, among other things, to cheat, to impersonate, to plagiarize or misappropriate the work of others, to practice improper research procedures, to be dishonest in publication, to aid and abet academic misconduct or to undertake any other action that runs counter to academic honesty. In addition, some forms of breach of academic honesty might constitute offences under the Criminal Code of Canada. While the pressures of school may be such that a student may feel pressured to breach academic honesty, students must completely resist such pressures. Students who are unsure of what may constitute a breach of academic honesty should consult with the Senate Policy on Academic Honesty (in the Policies and Regulations section) or with the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change Office of Student and Academic Services.</p>

<h3>Faculty Transfers</h3>

<p>Students who were last registered in an undergraduate degree program in another Faculty of York University and who wish to transfer to the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change must submit a Program Change Request, available on the Program Change Web page at <a href="https://myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/program-change" title="https:/myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/program-change">myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/program-change</a>.

              <div>
            <div><p>These programs offered in the former Faculty of Environmental Studies and the Department of Geography, Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies have been transferred to the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change. The following legacy program rules for these programs will be in effect until 2026 convocation:</p>

<p>Students who are moved into the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change will be coded into a program of study that corresponds to the program of study they were pursuing at the Faculty of Environmental Studies and the Department of Geography in the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies. Student who opt to change their program of study once moved will follow the new program rules implemented by the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change and will be coded into a new program of study. It is intended that this change will not create hardship for students but rather allow for the most clarity in terms of programs of study options.</p>

<p>Students who are declaring their Major effective for the Fall/Winter 2021-2022 session must choose a program of study in the new Faculty rather than choosing from the set of legacy programs. Students who change from a program of study with a single Major to a new program of study with a Double Major or a new program with a Major/Minor option will follow the rules established for the new program of study. It is assumed that the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change will use discretion at the time of graduation to accommodate any students inadvertently disadvantaged by the rules of the new program of study.</p>

<p>Previous students from the Faculty of Environmental Studies and the Department of Geography in the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies who have been away for less than four consecutive sessions (2 academic years or less) and who reactivate before the Summer 2023 session will be eligible to follow legacy program rules from their original Faculty (Faculty of Environmental Studies or Department of Geography in the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies). Students will be able to follow these legacy program rules until convocation exercises in October 2026; Summer 2026 will be the final academic term for the legacy program rules. Students who have not completed programs with the legacy program rules as of the Summer 2026 session will be required to complete their degrees and programs under the rules implemented by the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change.</p>

<p>Students who have been away for more than four consecutive sessions (2 academic years or less); <em>or</em> previous students from the Faculty of Environmental Studies and the Department of Geography in the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies who reactivate after the Summer 2023 will follow the rules in place at the time of reactivation.<br />

<p>The purpose of academic regulations is to allow students to develop their interests and talents to the fullest in ways consistent with the philosophy and standards of the Faculty. In establishing academic regulations, the Faculty also recognizes that instances will arise where it makes sense, in the context of a student's academic career, to waive regulations which would otherwise apply. The purpose of a student academic petition is to request an exemption from a Faculty regulation or deadline. Being unfamiliar with regulations or deadlines does not constitute a valid reason for an academic petition.</p>

<p>Students are expected to familiarize themselves with the University guidelines and principles regarding academic petitions before taking any steps which may have repercussions or affect their academic progress.&nbsp;<a href="https://calendars.students.yorku.ca/">calendars.students.yorku.ca</a></p>

<h4>Students’ Responsibilities in the Academic Petition/Appeals Process</h4>

<p>The University has established regulations, procedures and deadlines through its legislative bodies to which students must adhere. Students are expected to monitor their progress in courses, taking into account their personal and academic circumstances, and to make the necessary adjustments to their workload to meet the requirements and deadlines. The University recognizes, however, that specific circumstances may justify waiving the regulations/requirements/deadlines on an individual basis. Request for a waiver of a regulation/requirement/deadline are initiated by an academic petition.</p>

<p>Students opting to initiate an academic petition should be assured that confidentiality is a hallmark of this process.</p>

<p>While it is the University's responsibility to provide students with proper information, guidance and advice, it is incumbent upon students to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>be aware of and adhere to all Faculty and program regulations, requirements and published deadlines;</li>
	<li>familiarize themselves with their Faculty's written academic petition/appeal procedures and make requests in a timely fashion;</li>
	<li>provide all documentation to support their academic petition/appeal and to do so in a timely fashion;</li>
	<li>indicate and document all their relevant circumstances upon submitting their academic petition in the first instance.</li>
</ul>

<p>For further petition/appeal information, please refer to <u><a href="https://myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/academic-petitions">myacademicrecord.students.yorku.ca/academic-petitions</a></u>.</p>

<h4>Petition Appeal</h4>

<p>An appeal is a written request for the alteration of the decision taken on a petition.&nbsp; The decision of the Undergraduate Pedagogy, Academic Standards, and Awards Committee (UG PASA) shall be final and may be appealed to the UG PASA Appeals Sub-Committee and will be permitted only on the grounds of:</p>

            <div><p>In the Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change (EUC), the Office of Student and Academic Services (OSAS) provides EUC students with supportive services and resources to reach their utmost success.</p>

<p>OSAS works closely with other campus associates and colleagues to establish and maintain a welcoming and enthusiastic experience for our students as they progress through their program at York University. OSAS provides a confidential and safe environment for students to receive the assistance they require.</p>

<p>Academic Advising in the EUC is an interactive process in which the student with the help of the Advisor, will set and achieve their academic and professional goals, learn and utilize the relevant information and services to assist them, and to make responsible decisions consistent with interests, goals, and degree requirements. The Academic Advisor may also make referrals for student concerns to other campus services.</p>

<p>Academic Advisor(s) in EUC will:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Assist all incoming and current students to develop their academic plan to graduate.</li>
	<li>Review student course selections in relation to completing their program, degree requirements and goals for the future.</li>
	<li>Provide accurate information so that students may make informed decisions about their program.</li>
	<li>Provide opportunities to discuss academic standing, cumulative GPA academic regulations, integrity concerns, petition and program change requests.</li>
	<li>Explain the petition procedure and interpret the Senate regulations.</li>
	<li>Inform the student about the various resources and services available on campus as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Advisor(s) is available from 8:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m. Monday to Friday, excluding holidays. The Advisor can be reached at <a href="mailto:eucadvise@yorku.ca">eucadvise@yorku.ca</a>.</p>
